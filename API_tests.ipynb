This week hes back at Minute Maid after helping lead the Braves to their first World Series appearance since 1999.\\nAnthopoulos and Houston general manager James Click took over teams in turmoil. Anthopoulos was hired six weeks after GM John Coppolella was forced to resign when Major League Baseballs investigation uncovered rules violations committed by the Braves in the international player market. Click was the No. 3 official in the Tampa Bay Rays baseball department when he was hired by the Astros in February 2020, three weeks after GM Jeff Luhnow was suspended by MLB and then fired by Houston for his role in the teams sign-stealing scandal.\\nAdvertisement\\nStory continues below advertisement\\nAnd just after getting his new job, Clicks orientation was disrupted by the pandemic. He wasnt able to have coffee and dinners with staff for a year.\\nI was here for four or five weeks before the world shut down, he said Monday ahead of the World Series opener, which the Braves won 6-2 Tuesday night. And so I had to try to do as much of it over Zoom and other means as possible, which is challenging. Not being able to observe people at their jobs in their natural environment can make it challenging to get to know everybody.\\nClick, a 43-year-old Yale history major, and Anthopoulos, a 44-year-old economics major at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, lead organizations with celebrated managers seeking their first dugout titles: Houstons 72-year-old Dusty Baker and Atlantas 66-year-old Brian Snitker, completing his 45th season in the Braves organization.\\nAdvertisement\\nStory continues below advertisement\\nBoth teams won pennants with high but not leading payrolls: Houston was eighth at $188 million as of Aug. 31 and Atlanta 15th at $149 million.\\nBorn in Montreal, Anthopoulos started as an intern with the low-spending Expos in 2000, joined Toronto as scouting coordinator and rose to general manager in 2009. He left in January 2016 to become the Dodgers VP of baseball operations under Andrew Friedman and Farhan Zaidi, and got the Braves job less than two seasons later.\\nId been in Toronto six years and I thought I was improving as a GM, he said. Going to LA, it was like going to grad school for two years. I wish Id had another year or two because I was learning a ton and I took a ton of what I learned, that I brought it to Atlanta.\\nStory continues below advertisement\\nAnthopoulos thinks of the example of Billy Beane, who is starting his 25th year as head of the Oakland Athletics baseball operations.\\nAdvertisement\\nNever the excuses of, Oh, not having resources or money. He always tries to win, Anthopoulos said. They dont do rebuilds. And Farhan will say the same thing: Im not into three-year plans, five-year plans. Im just trying to make good decisions and win when we win.\\nAs Atlanta approached the All-Star break below .500 following the loss of all three starting outfielders, Anthopolous recalled a conversation he had with Beane in May or June.\\nIf youre close, two months is a long time, 60 games is a lot of games, and you just need to be close because a lot of teams are just going to quit, and its going to give you an opportunity, he said Beane told him. It doesnt sound that complicated, but it makes sense.\\nStory continues below advertisement\\nAtlanta obtained outfielders Eddie Rosario, Adam Duvall and Jorge Soler along with reliever Richard Rodrguez in four swaps in the hours before the July 30 trade deadline, adding to the acquisition of outfielder Joc Pederson two weeks earlier.\\nAdvertisement\\nRosario, Duvall and Pederson combined to drive in 17 of Atlantas 28 runs in its six-game NL Championship Series win over the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers. Rosario was selected MVP.\\nAnthopoulos behaved quite differently at the 2014 trade deadline.\\nI did a poor job of not holding money back in the offseason, he said. I made excuses for myself. ... Instead of like: How can we? I was just like: Oh, we dont have any money, Im not going to trade a bunch of players long-term.\\nStory continues below advertisement\\nClick, born in Durham, North Carolina, was a Rays intern in 2005, was hired a year later as coordinator of baseball operations, then promoted to director of baseball research and development, director of baseball operations and made a vice president in 2017.\\nHe engineered the rebuilding of Houstons bullpen. The Astros acquired left-hander Brooks Raley from Cincinnati in August 2020 and added Kendall Graveman, Phil Maton and Yimi Garca ahead of this years deadline.\\nAdvertisement\\nClick found the way of doing business in Houston surprisingly different.\\nI think the culture of hitting here, the way that the hitters interact with each other, the way that they prepare, was eye-opening to me, Click said. But also talking to Brent Strom and the coaches about their philosophy of pitching and how it is similar to Tampas and how its different was eye-opening. I think you learn more from when you have difference than when you agree.\\nStory continues below advertisement\\nBoth are of the mindset that aggressiveness pays off.

How some chose to react to it is a different story.\",\"body\":\"ArrowRight\\nBut today, the actor is richly deserving of our sympathy. His accidental lethal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, 42, and wounding of movie director Joel Souza, 48, on the set of Rust last week is the stuff of nightmares. Sadly, Baldwin doesnt get to wake up to the realization that it was all a bad dream.\\nI dont know how one navigates that kind of horror. Plenty of people have had to find out. Though accidental gun deaths are relatively rare (under 2 percentof all shooting deaths) compared with suicides and homicides, this isnt a first for the movie industry. Most infamously, Brandon Leewas fatally shot on the set of The Crow in 1993. In both cases, the deaths were, by definition, avoidable had safety precautions been properly taken.\\nAdvertisement\\nStory continues below advertisement\\nDetails of the Rust shooting are still emerging. Two people were reportedly responsiblefor securing the prop guns safety. First was 24-year-old armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed. The Los Angeles Times reportedthat two other accidental discharges already had occurred on the set. The armorer is in charge of making sure prop guns are free of live ammunition.\\nSecond in line was assistant director Dave Halls, who also was supposed to check the gun. When he handed it to Baldwin, Halls reportedly shouted, \\ncold gun\\n, meaning it contained no live ammunition.\\nWhat happened in Baldwins case was an instant of random timing intersecting with human fallibility. Hutchins wasnt filming when Baldwin sat down on a church pew to practice a shot in which he used his draw hand to pull his gun from the holster on the other side of his body. The first time he drew, nothing happened. The second time, the gun fired and hit both people at once. Souza was behind Hutchins at the time, looking over her shoulder.\\nAdvertisement\\nStory continues below advertisement\\nSuch details haunt the imagination. We put ourselves in Baldwins shoes and try to imagine what he felt upon realizing what had happened. Seeing him so distraught and plainly grieving in photos snapped after the shooting should move anyone to empathy and pause our nations default cynicism. But not in our spiritually hollowed-out world, where meanness is a virtue and hatred is the coin of the realm.\\nOf all people, J.D. Vance, author of Hillbilly Elegy and a Republican Senate candidate in Ohio, tweetedthe following to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey: Dear @jack let Trump back on. We need Alec Baldwin tweets. As is well known, Twitter banned Donald Trump from the platform after the Jan. 6 insurrection.\\nI cant fathom how someone so apparently intelligent and empathic as Vance could resort to such callousness. This is the same man who wrote a critically acclaimed memoir of his White working-class upbringing that shed needed light on Trumps rise to power. In so doing, he exposed his own family with a raw realism, coupled with humor. I loved both the book and the movie that was made from it. But Vance has squandered any good will toward him with his desperate grab for Trumpworld approval.\\nAdvertisement\\nStory continues below advertisement\\nIn so doing, too, Vance may have written his own tragedy. By any measure, he should lose his campaign. In a better world, it would be because he insulted the Trump (and his own) base by implying that theyd applaud the mocking of people in shock and grief. Meanwhile, Trump has been a bystander to this story who, one can always hope, has discovered the interior rewards of the high road. He may well despise Baldwin for his wicked impersonations of him on Saturday Night Live, which were hilarious to anyone with a sense of humor. But contrary to Vances craven calculation, Trump has stayed silent on the tragedy.\\nNot so Donald Trump Jr., who has been hawking T-shirtswith the slogan: Guns dont kill people, Alec Baldwin kills people. Uncharmingly, he offered an unprintable defense to critics of the shirts that summed up his character.\\nAs investigation into the shooting continues, two things seem true: What Baldwin did was a terrible accident. What Vance and the younger Trump have done were attacks not only on Baldwin but also on every American who values and strives for decency.\\nIts time to stop giving passes to such people and to support only those who can demonstrate by words and deeds that they know what decency and civility are. Isnt that the world we want for our children and grandchildren? It shouldnt be hard to sort them all out.\\nGiftOutline\",\"snippet\":\"Human fallibility and random timing produced tragedy for Alec Baldwin and Halyna Hutchins.\\nHow some chose to react to it is a different story.\",\"keywords\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"isSafe\":true,\"datePublished\":\"2021-10-27T01:30:33.025\",\"provider\":{\"name\":\"washingtonpost\",\"favIcon\":\"\",\"favIconBase64Encoding\":\"\"},\"image\":{\"url\":\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LAWLUURVSYI6ZFTCHGOPU5PP5Y.jpg&amp;w=1440\",\"height\":0,\"width\":0,\"thumbnail\":\"\",\"thumbnailHeight\":0,\"thumbnailWidth\":0,\"base64Encoding\":\"\",\"name\":null,\"title\":null,\"provider\":{\"name\":\"washingtonpost\",\"favIcon\":\"\",\"favIconBase64Encoding\":\"\"},\"imageWebSearchUrl\":null,\"webpageUrl\":\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/26/alec-baldwin-rust-lesson-decency/\"}},{\"id\":\"5899675465676462950\",\"title\":\"Biden campaigns for McAuliffe in Virginia governors race addressing Arlington crowd\",\"url\":\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/10/26/biden-virginia-election-mcauliffe-governor/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_politics\",\"description\":\"With national eyes on Virginia now, just a week before the state conducts the first real electoral test of the Biden presidency, the stage was big, and the stakes were high.\",\"body\":\"10:22 p.m. EDT\\nShare this story\\nPresident Biden returned to the campaign trail for Terry McAuliffe on Tuesday, urging Virginia voters to back the former governor in the tight race for his old job against Republican Glenn Youngkin.\\nYou all know the stakes, Biden told the crowd during a chilly evening at Arlingtons Virginia Highlands Park. You dont have to wonder what kind of governor Terry will be, because you know what a great governor he was.\\nArrowRight\\nThe rally, featuring a whos who of top Democratic elected officials from Northern Virginia, marked the second time this year that Biden had crossed the Potomac to headline a rally alongside McAuliffe, a longtime friend.\\nBut with national attention on Virginia just a week before the state conducts the first real electoral test of the Biden presidency, the stage was bigger Tuesday and the stakes were higher.\\nAdvertisement\\nStory continues below advertisement\\nAlready, national Democratic Party strategists are looking to Virginia as an indicator of the partys chances in next years midterm congressional elections  and of voter attitudes toward Biden. After Biden retained strong popularity during his first six months in office, his approval numbers started slipping in August amid a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and a Capitol Hill logjam over his domestic agenda.\\nMcAuliffe himself has said that Biden is unpopular. He has tried to distance himself from the president in some ways and called on Democrats to set aside their disagreements and push through a bipartisan infrastructure bill.\\nAs the two men took the stage on Tuesday night, that goal remained unfulfilled. Given the cheery compliments the two gave each other, though, it would have been difficult to tell.\\nAdvertisement\\nStory continues below advertisement\\nBiden, who introduced himself as Jill Bidens husband, mentioned that he had come to Arlington only because the first lady teaches at Northern Virginia Community College, just a few miles away.\\nTerrys going to be her boss, he said, eliciting light laughter from the crowd. He then went on to praise McAuliffes efforts to improve rail transportation in Virginia, expand prekindergarten and secure high-speed broadband across the state.\\nObama casts the Virginia election as historic, but will his energy spark Democrats to vote?\\nMuch like when he campaigned for McAuliffe in July, Biden sought aggressively to link Youngkin to former president Donald Trump, mentioning Trumps false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and tying Youngkin to that rhetoric, as well as the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\\nStory continues below advertisement\\nExtremism can come in many forms. It can come in the rage of a mob driven to assault the Capitol. It can come in a smile and a fleece vest, he said, referring to Youngkins red outfit on the campaign trail. Either way, the big lie is still the big lie.\\nAdvertisement\\nAs Youngkin embarks on a final, 50-stop tour across the state, the former private equity executive has kept Trump at arms length in his appeal for moderate and independent suburban voters.\\nTrump has offered several endorsements of the Republican candidate, at one point calling into a rallyon his behalf earlier this month. But Youngkin has on several occasions evaded saying whether he wants the former presidents support.\\nStory continues below advertisement\\nFormer vice president Mike Pence also is making an appearance in Virginia. He is set to speak  in Loudoun County on Thursday on the topic of educational freedom.\\nWhile the address is not being billed as a campaign event, Loudoun is the  main venue where Youngkin and other Republicans have rallied against critical race theory, an academic concept that is not included in Virginia public school curriculums.\\nNext weeks election also includes competitive races for lieutenant governor, attorney general and every seat in the 100-member House of Delegates, where Democrats are defending a 55-to-45 majority.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe party is hoping to preserve the legislative advantage that has enabled it  to push Virginia leftward on matters from marijuana to the death penalty, much of it powered by anti-Trump sentiment.\\nStory continues below advertisement\\nTrumps absence from the ballot  will test whether Democrats can maintain their hold on power in Richmond  without a similar animating force  and as their partys leader faces fallen approval numbers.\\nBut even amid questions about Bidens popularity, those huddling under the floodlights  Tuesday night voiced strong enthusiasm for Biden and McAuliffe. In interviews, some brushed aside the presidents  poll numbers and blamed his dearth of legislative accomplishments on Republican resistance.\\nDivya Kapoor, a 22-year-old tech analyst who just moved to Arlingtons Pentagon City neighborhood from Maryland, said she was still researching the candidates in her new state.

But if our president supports him, them I support [him].\\nAnd for Brian Stillwaugh, 42, a stay-at-home dad and Alexandria resident, Trump was still enough of a motivating factor to cast his entire ballot in favor of the Democratic ticket.\\nIve always considered myself to be a moderate, but I havent liked the direction the Republican Party has bee headed in, he said, wearing an I Voted sticker from his early-voting trip to the polls earlier that afternoon.\\nMore on the 2021 Virginia election\\nLatest news:\",\"snippet\":\"With national eyes on Virginia now, just a week before the state conducts the first real electoral test of the Biden presidency, the stage was big, and the stakes were high.\",\"keywords\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"isSafe\":true,\"datePublished\":\"2021-10-27T02:22:19\",\"provider\":{\"name\":\"washingtonpost\",\"favIcon\":\"\",\"favIconBase64Encoding\":\"\"},\"image\":{\"url\":\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OH4ZBNBWYEI6ZFTCHGOPU5PP5Y.jpg&amp;w=1440\",\"height\":0,\"width\":0,\"thumbnail\":\"\",\"thumbnailHeight\":0,\"thumbnailWidth\":0,\"base64Encoding\":\"\",\"name\":null,\"title\":null,\"provider\":{\"name\":\"washingtonpost\",\"favIcon\":\"\",\"favIconBase64Encoding\":\"\"},\"imageWebSearchUrl\":null,\"webpageUrl\":\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/10/26/biden-virginia-election-mcauliffe-governor/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_politics\"}},{\"id\":\"6350917184000549700\",\"title\":\"LeBron James to miss Lakers game vs. Spurs due to sore ankle\",\"url\":\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nba/lebron-james-to-miss-lakers-game-vs-spurs-due-to-sore-ankle/2021/10/26/94580062-36b9-11ec-9662-399cfa75efee_story.html\",\"description\":\"LeBron James will not play in the Los Angeles Lakers game against the Spurs in San Antonio on Tuesday night due to a sore right ankle\",\"body\":\"ArrowRight\\nThere was some soreness and we are taking the marathon approach (to the season), Lakers coach Frank Vogel said.\\nVogel said this injury is in a different spot from the right ankle injury James suffered through late last season.\\nMalik Monk will start in place of James.\\nVogel said James is questionable for Wednesdays game at Oklahoma City.\\nStory continues below advertisement\\nLets see how he feels, Vogel said.

But this will be the first time the elder Baldwins coached his son on an actual team.\\nPat Baldwin is entering his fifth season as Milwaukees coach after working as an assistant at Northwestern, Missouri State, Loyola-Chicago and Green Bay. Patrick Baldwin praised his dad for the way he handled the unusual assignment of recruiting a family member.\\nAdvertisement\\nHe was super hands-off, Patrick Baldwin said. He let it be my decision. He let me take control of my legacy and career. I give him major props for that. Because I think if I was in his position, I definitely would have pushed the issue.\\nStory continues below advertisement\\nPatrick Baldwin is living on campus rather than at home, which will allow the father and son to spend at least some time apart. But theyre looking forward to all the hours theyll spend together on the court.\\nThe opportunity to coach his son makes this a season unlike any other for Pat Baldwin. Hes received plenty of advice from other coaches who have been in this position, such as Iowas Fran McCaffery and former Detroit coach Ray McCallum.\\nTheir suggestions had a similar theme.\\nCoach him like hes one of the kids on the team, Pat Baldwin said. Thats what Patrick wants as well, how he wants to be coached. He wants to be challenged. He wants to become the best he can possibly be. The advice that all of them gave is just to coach him, and (that) his teammates need to know that I can coach him.\\nAdvertisement\\nStory continues below advertisement\\nThats just the message Patrick Baldwin wants to hear. He says the lessons hes received from his father through the years helped him get this far in the first place.\\nHis best advice through my entire life was just to put your head down and work, the younger Baldwin said. Because especially in this day and age of social media where you can put your platform out there and air out your opinions, if you just put your head down and work, you can do pretty much anything in life.\\nHeres a look at some other freshmen who could make an impact this season.\\nDUKE: F Paolo Banchero\\nBanchero, a 6-9 forward from Seattle, is the first player from the state of Washington to play for Duke since Quin Snyder suited up for the Blue Devils from 1986-89.

Some of whats being revealed is genuinely outrageous, such as Facebooks accommodation of dictators overseas, and its dissemination of information abroad by human traffickers, drug cartels and other illegal actors.\\nBut before Congress rushes to create a new Department of Algorithm Review, I suggest we recall Walt Kellys commentin his comic strip, Pogo, to wit: We have met the enemy, and he is us. In so many instances of disinformation about politics, vaccines or anything else, the problem is often a bottom-up viral spread of dangerous information by social media users. The information might be toxic, but it usually isnt illegal  and in America we have a First Amendment that protects speech, even the nastier versions.\\nAdvertisement\\nStory continues below advertisement\\nBeyond Facebook, I have a deeper worry. The Internet was created with an idealistic dream: The global propagation of open information would expand human freedom and democracy. As the world became flat and citizens were empowered, authoritarian rulers would become weaker. Alas, it hasnt worked out that way. The paradox of the Internet is that it has enabled greater control by authoritarians and fueled greater disorder in open democracies.\\nAmericans who are anguished about former president Donald Trump keep looking for a villain to blame (other than Trump himself and his movement). After the 2016 presidential campaign, investigators hunted a conspiracy driven by Russia. Now, theres a similar fixation on Facebook as the root of our political dysfunction. If only Trumpism were as easy to explain as a Moscow or Facebook plot! But the veins of rage, left and right, were there to exploit, politically and financially, well before Trump.\\nThomas Rid, author of \\nActive Measures\\n, an authoritative 2020 study of disinformation, notes the meme that Zuckerberg is a malevolent machine. Many cannot resist the temptation to blame some of the worst ills of our time on this company and its aloof CEO, he noted in an email message this week.\\nAdvertisement\\nStory continues below advertisement\\nThe more accurate insight is so hard and so taboo that many of us dare not say it out loud, Rid continued. Is it Facebook or the Internet that is bringing out the worst in us? Is the Internet merely revealing and amplifying what the old media gatekeepers kept in check? Is there a point where too much democratizing of information will lead to a closing of our societies?\\nAlex Stamos, a former chief of security for Facebook and now director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, notes that the very openness of the Internet is part of todays problem. Once, media gatekeepers limited what was disseminated. Now, you get a vast buffet that has some healthy foods, and also some heroin, and a lot of people take heroin, he explained in an interview.\\nSocial media was supposed to be an open ecosystem. But as people find their niches and preferences, they create closed loops for themselves. Facebook is designed to deliver to users information that they like, from people that they like, in rapid fashion, argues Clint Watts, a former FBI agent and leading authority on disinformation.\\nAdvertisement\\nStory continues below advertisement\\nStamos helped lead a detailed studyof misinformation in the 2020 election, conducted by the Election Integrity Partnership. The inquiry examined how false information was spread. Often it started with small incidents, reported from the bottom up, that were then disseminated by a relatively small number of repeat spreaders, who would retweet or otherwise amplify the lie.\\nThe answer, says Stamos, is to increase friction on the Internet, so that its harder for these lies to become viral. That means limiting retweets and shares  rather than trying to police the information itself. I dont want Facebook to try to fix American politics, Stamos argues, and hes right. A hypothetical government social media agency shouldnt try to fix our politics, either. Thats a road to tyranny.\\nCongress should rewrite some of the rules that bound the Internet. For example, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act should be amended so that social media companies can be sued if they design algorithms that propagate false information. But total repeal of Section 230 would be a mistake, because it would encourage endless defamation litigation and discourage platforms from carrying true stories that are critical of the rich and powerful.\\nHeres the awkward truth: Regulation of social media ultimately is on us  the users. We have to teach ourselves, our children and our friends to monitor content and weed out whats false and hateful.
