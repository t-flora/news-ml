Under a contract announced today, which does not mention specific financial backing for the program, Army engineers will participate in flight testing, “to evaluate mission applicability, including measures of range, altitude, endurance, and payload limits before testing specific cargo and logistics missions.”

Beta’s flight-test program has also been supported by the U.S. Air Force, which last year issued military airworthiness approval for the Alia and provided funding under an earlier contract as part of its Agility Prime program. The company has conducted multiple flights between its headquarters at Burlington International Airport in Vermont and nearby Plattsburg in New York. The longest flight to date with the all-electric aircraft, which uses fixed-pitch propellers, was 205 miles and it has cruised at altitudes of 8,000 feet.

“This partnership with the Army marks another important step in the military’s commitment to advancing and adopting sustainable electric aviation solutions,” said Beta founder and CEO Kyle Clark. “We’re gratified by the continued support of the sector, and this allows us to accelerate our development of Alia as an incredibly safe and reliable logistics aircraft for both military and civil applications.”

The company’s board of directors includes Will Roper, the former U.S. assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, technology, and logistics. He was instrumental in establishing the Agility Prime program, which is seeking to support efforts to exploit the potential for eVTOL aircraft for use in military missions, mainly through small business technology transfer contracts.

During the Reagan National Defense Forum held on December 5, 2021, the Air Force's chief of staff, General Charles Brown, praised the Afwerx program for expediting the development of technology that could strengthen national defense. ""It has marked a real cultural shift [in how public and private sectors collaborate], so we work very closely together rather than just pushing [a product or technology] back and forth over a fence until it works,"" he commented.

In the commercial aviation market, several prospective customers have signed “rights to purchase” the Alia, which is expected to complete FAA Part 23 type certification in 2024. These include express delivery group UPS, which plans to add 150 aircraft to its fleet, the medical group United Therapeutics, which intends to transport human organs for transplant, and passenger charter flight booking platform Blade Urban Air Mobility.

CAE announced today that BETA Technologies (BETA) selected CAE as its partner of choice to design and develop its pilot and maintenance technician training program for the ALIA eVTOL aircraft. CAE will leverage its decades of training expertise to develop a full suite of innovative, digitally integrated curriculum and courseware solutions for the aviation workforce of tomorrow. The new training program will be built from the ground-up, in parallel with BETA’s aircraft certification journey, taking into account the unique operational and mission specific inputs for this aircraft.

Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) covers a range of revolutionary new aircraft enabling transport of people and cargo between places previously not served or underserved by civil aviation, with eVTOL aircraft at the forefront. In support of this emerging market, CAE’s dedicated Advanced Air Mobility group offers training and operational support solutions to help innovative companies such as BETA certify their eVTOL aircraft, train their pilots and maintainers, and scale standardized AAM operations across global markets.

“CAE has a rich history in participating in the development and launch of many innovative aircraft,"" said Kyle Clark, Founder & CEO at BETA. “Flying and maintaining electric aircraft requires an understanding of electric systems and flight dynamics that are new to aviation. Our team is thrilled to be bringing in CAE’s expertise into the fold as we work hand in hand to teach the next generation of pilots and mechanics the unique aspects of flying and maintaining electric aircraft.

“We are drawing on CAE’s close to 75 years of aviation industry thought leadership to help accelerate the advancement of the Advanced Air Mobility industry. We are very excited to partner in the enablement of this new generation of aviators and technicians, who we believe will play a key role in the future success of this revolutionary industry,” said Nick Leontidis, CAE’s Group President, Civil Aviation Training Solutions. “CAE is a high technology solutions company at the leading edge of digital immersion, and we are committed to supporting the continuing needs of BETA and its operators throughout the lifecycle of the program. This marks the first step to what we believe will be a long-term partnership with BETA, and another example of our commitment to future aviation technologies and sustainability”.

BETA brings a diverse customer base to the advanced air mobility market. BETA is the first eVTOL to receive manned airworthiness from the U.S. Air Force and the company has customers across a suite of industries including logistics (UPS Flight Forward), medical (United Therapeutics), passenger (Blade), and military (U.S. Air Force). BETA has hundreds of hours of manned full-scale flight testing and recently flew its ALIA aircraft over 200 miles.

In November 2020, CAE released a report on 2020-2029 Pilot Demand Outlook in which it was estimated that an expected global requirement of 264,000 new pilots were needed in the civil aviation industry to sustain growth over the next ten years. This does not take into account the additional surge in demand for pilots and technicians in Advanced Air Mobility. CAE is committed to leveraging new digital technologies and developing training methodologies designed for a faster, better, and more efficient throughput of highly qualified pilots and maintenance technicians for this new era of aviation.",CAE,,
2,https://evtol.com/features/why-evtol-developer-beta-gives-employees-free-flight-training/,"When many people contemplate the benefits of a given job, a few common questions come to mind. Will the company in question provide medical insurance? What about 401(k) retirement plan matching? Oh, and what’s the vacation policy like?

While all of those things are clearly important, Burlington, Vermont-based eVTOL developer Beta Technologies has long attached another piece to its benefits package: free flight training. Now, as the company ramps up its testing program and inches closer to its goal of commercializing the all-electric Alia 250 aircraft, that’s something the company — and its employees — believe will give them an upper hand in the increasingly competitive eVTOL space.

Beta CEO Kyle Clark says the company’s pilot training program gives every employee a direct connection to Beta’s mission. Beta Technologies Photo

Beta’s flight training program allows for employees, regardless of their position, to get various certificates and ratings completely on the company’s dime. The eVTOL developer owns and maintains several training aircraft, has 17 dedicated certified flight instructors (CFIs) to work with employees, and leverages an extensive in-house maintenance staff to keep the entire operation running. According to a company spokesperson, Beta’s CFIs — many of whom have previous military or airline experience — average 4,000 hours of flight experience, while its maintenance personnel average 20 years on the job.

For that reason, while Beta is still an eVTOL developer at heart, the company’s flying operation more closely resembles a flight school or small charter operation. In addition to flight training, Beta also uses its fleet of more than a dozen conventional aircraft for logistics and transportation.

For intern Bella Riely, flight training allowed her to have a more intimate understanding of aviation concepts and language, which was otherwise absent for someone with little industry experience. “When I came to Beta, it was a full immersion experience: I started working on the scale model and people were talking about ailerons and elevators and I was like, ‘I have no idea what’s happening,’” she said. “So, to be able to get my hands on a yoke and be in the cockpit manipulating flight controls, it helped me connect with the people as well as the aircraft and the job.”

Beta uses its in-house aircraft to help keep its pilot employees safe and current, in addition to introducing non-pilot employees to the joys of flight. Beta Technologies Photo

While someone in Riely’s role — who works on 3D modeling and prototyping — may not directly be flying for her job, the knowledge she gains through flight training helps her at her desk. Meanwhile, for Lochie Ferrier, a flight test engineer and pilot for Beta, integrating flying right into his day-to-day activities is vital to program safety, he said. Specifically, Ferrier said that it’s not uncommon for flight test programs to have pilots with multiple month-long gaps in their currency because, in many cases, the actual test aircraft don’t fly that much. For Beta, having dedicated aircraft in house keeps people safe and current during those gaps.

Keeping pilots current this way and expanding the number of people in the company who can fly also creates what Ferrier calls “Swiss army knife” employees, or people who can do lots of tasks and do them well. According to Ferrier, Lan Vu, another pilot who spoke to eVTOL.com, is one of these people. “Lan can watch telemetry, build batteries, fly planes to go build batteries, complete safety reviews, and so on. The whole pilot piece has made Lan to be way more useful to the team I work on for sure,” he said.

Vu said that she, like others at the company, had no direct experience with aviation before coming to work at Beta. “I really had no thought I would even fly a plane before working here,” she said.

Vu’s story isn’t unique, and the company’s flight training initiative seems to be producing more and more people like her — coming with no aviation experience, and emerging as a pilot as well as a seasoned Beta employee.

“At Beta, our mission is to build the best electric aerospace company. Our flight program is borne of the belief that there’s no better way to understand flight, and what pilots really need in the aircraft, than to fly yourself,” a Beta spokesperson said. Company CEO Kyle Clark also sees this as a key part of Beta’s overall mission: “Beta’s employee pilot training program gives every Beta employee a direct connection to the company mission,” he emphasized.

And while all that’s great, the elephant in the room couldn’t be more obvious: covering flight training costs for a company with hundreds of employees can’t be cheap. While Beta has serious incoming cashflow from investors such as Fidelity Management and Amazon’s Climate Change Fund, and orders on the docket from Blade and UPS, aircraft certification is a fraught and expensive process that is likely to require all of the capital that Beta can throw at it.

However, Ferrier sees the flight training program as an interconnected piece of the work the company does, and thus the cost as justifiable. He said that, just as other companies invest in professional development opportunities for employees and other educational perks, Beta’s flight training program operates in a similar manner by providing employees with relevant, useful skills for the job.

“Imagine if everyone who is designing cars at Ford had never driven a car before,” he said. “That car would be really, really bad.”",Why eVTOL developer Beta gives its employees free flight training,,

WCS student tours electric airplane company founded by WCS alumnus

BY JASON STARR

Observer staff

Sixth-grader Jonah Wayman has a lot in common with Beta Technologies founder and CEO Kyle Clark. Both are Williston Central School-educated, both are captivated by aviation and both are bullish on electric-powered flight.

Beta Technologies is developing electric airplanes out of its headquarters at Burlington International Airport and two manufacturing facilities on Avenue D in Williston. Wayman reached out to the company as part of his “Genius Hour” project on electric planes in Joy Peterson and Jared Bailey’s humanities class at Williston Central.

The company, fresh off an eye-popping ($368 million) investment announcement from Amazon and Fidelity, presented Wayman an unforgettable offer: spend a day at the airport, flying in a helicopter piloted by former Obama Administration Marine One pilot Nick Warren, testing out a flight simulator, meeting engineers and pilots and touring a model electric plane lab. Wayman’s day at Beta was this Wednesday. On June 11, the company plans a flyover above Williston Central School as part of the students’ Genius Hour open house.

“This is my dream come true,” Wayman said Tuesday. “It’s really exciting. I’m going to learn a lot. It’s going to be really fun.”

Katie Clark, who works in community outreach and communications for the company, hears echoes of CEO Kyle Clark (her husband) in Wayman’s enthusiasm.

Kyle Clark grew up in Williston and went to WCS until his eighth-grade year, when he moved to Essex. He graduated from Essex High School — where he met Katie — and went on to study math and engineering at Harvard. According to Katie, Kyle used a signing bonus from the Washington Capitals where he had signed on to play professional hockey in the NHL, to instead enroll in flight school and become a licensed pilot.

“Jonah sounds a lot like Kyle did when he was a kid,” Katie said. “His passion for aviation goes back as long as he can remember. And he loves inspiring kids to fly.”

The company’s community outreach efforts were hampered over the past year by the pandemic. Wayman’s visit marks the start of a renewed effort to “inspire the next generation of aviators,” Katie said. She predicts that thousands of pilots and mechanics are going to be needed to work on electric aircraft in the future.

“We’re very excited about what we are doing here and really excited to share what we have going on with kids, students and the community,” she said. “It’s been a long time coming for us. If we can make an impact on a student who is passionate about aviation and share what we’ve learned and create a meaningful experience for him, that is super meaningful to us … We’re thrilled to have Jonah here and to show him around.”

The company’s aircraft, the Alia, is being developed as a manned delivery plane with investments from Amazon, UPS and United Therapeutics. The plane can take off and land vertically, reach speeds of 170 mph with a 250-mile range and carry over a ton of cargo, according to an April report in VTDigger. It is charged with ground chargers that the company manufactures on Avenue D.

The plane seats six. Passenger electric planes are in the company’s future plans, as are unmanned delivery planes.

“Our first roll out will be in delivery, but we are designing our aircraft to eventually move people as well,” Katie said.

Beta was founded in 2017 with eight employees. The company’s new facility at the airport will help it more than double from its current 200 employees.

“In the next few years, we’re going to have to be rolling out an aircraft a day to meet our goals and keep our promises,” Katie said.

The investments from UPS and Amazon are significant milestones for the company.

“It is a pretty big deal,” Katie said. “It shows a vote of confidence that we’re the real deal and that they have faith that we are a leader in this industry and we are going to be able to bring this product to market and make an impact on the environment. It’s validating to have companies like UPS and Amazon and United Therapeutics behind us and show that they believe in what we’re doing.”",Aviation inspiration – Williston Observer,,

Kara Hurst, vice president and head of worldwide sustainability at Amazon, said in a press release announcing the funding round. ""The development of sustainable and decarbonizing technologies will help facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy and protect the planet for future generations.""

""The Climate Pledge Fund is set up to allow technologies like ours to mature into the goals of Amazon,"" Clark said. ""There's sustainable solutions in buildings and obviously in ground-based vehicles, but aviation doesn't have a solution.""

""These are top tier investors. It's awesome to have the validation,"" Beta founder and CEO Kyle Clark told CNBC, speaking of breaking the so-called unicorn status of $1 billion. He added he envisions a future where Beta EVAs are used for Amazon Prime delivery.

EVAs also known as eVTOLS — electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft — can take off like a helicopter and fly like a plane.

Beta agreed in April to sell 10 of its Alia-250 EVAs to United Parcel Service in a deal with an option for an additional 140. UPS plans to test the aircraft for its express delivery in small and medium markets. Beta also announced last month a deal to supply as many as 20 EVAs to Blade Air Mobility for short-haul passenger flights. The Vermont-based start-up, founded in 2014, also has deals with the Air Force and United Therapeutics.

The emerging technology has seen major developments in 2021. In March, Joby Aviation announced that it's going public in a special purpose acquisition company deal at a $6.6 billion valuation. A month earlier, Archer said it would go public via SPAC at $3.8 billion valuation.

The Federal Aviation Administration must still certify the EVAs being manufactured by each company before they can start flying. Beta hopes to receive certification by 2024.

""I'm incredibly confident that we can achieve certification of this vehicle [Alia 250],"" Clark said. ""This is serious business, we're putting people's lives at stake and we have to get it right and therefore we are not going to take any shortcuts.""","Beta becomes latest electric vertical aircraft unicorn with Amazon's Climate Fund, Fidelity backing",2021-05-18 00:00:00,

The Alia aircraft

You can't not see the planes. Beta Technologies' two prized prototypes take up the center of its bustling headquarters inside a hangar at Burlington International Airport. Around the upper rim of the airy space, employee workstations overlook the lustrous white machines through long walls of glass. During a recent tour, a group of engineers studied aircraft designs on a projection screen in one conference room. Next door, two others played Ping-Pong.

The open office layout isn't to imitate Silicon Valley, or even to show off Beta's aircraft, founder and CEO Kyle Clark insisted. He thinks the glass helps get engineers talking to each other, which leads to a better plane. And Clark is obsessed with building a better plane.

The prototypes parked in the hangar are the first two iterations of Beta's latest, most promising design. With a 50-foot wingspan and a tall V-shaped tail, the aircraft dubbed Alia uses four propellers to lift like a drone and a fifth to fly forward like a plane. It's designed to carry six people or three pallets of cargo up to 250 miles, powered entirely by rechargeable electric batteries.

Alia represents an aviation breakthrough-in-waiting, physical evidence of how the far-off vision of flight without fossil fuel has become tantalizingly close.

For many, the nascent electric aviation field is synonymous with a fascination for flying cars. A new class of experimental aircraft called electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL), which includes Alia, promises quiet, efficient propulsion and the nimbleness of a helicopter. Add in advances toward pilotless operation, and the aircraft could usher in radically different skyscapes and personal transportation networks, the thinking goes. Accordingly, Silicon Valley has jumped in to fuel a race to create the first big electric air taxi company.

Beta, homegrown in the less-vaunted Champlain Valley, has leapt toward the front of the pack by charting a different flight path. Since founding the startup in 2017, Clark has been focused not on the Jetsons but on the planet. The quickest way to begin moving air travel away from fossil fuels, Clark said at a recent conference, is to build ""insanely reliable"" aircraft that are capable of more straightforward uses, such as transporting cargo.

Much of the work to achieve that goal takes place in labs on the South Burlington hangar's first floor, where there's considerably less glass than the trendy office space above. Here, Beta's engineers continue to refine the cutting-edge electric motors and control systems they've been developing quietly for the last few years.

The hangar at Beta Technologies

Between an electronics lab and the 3D printing shop is a pair of rooms that Clark — a slightly scruffy, six-foot-six engineer, serial entrepreneur and former pro hockey draft pick — introduces with a mechanic's charm as the ""torture chambers.""

In these tiny thunderdomes, Beta's most precious components get stuffed into cages and pushed toward their breaking point. They're cooked and frozen and shocked with the same voltage as a lightning strike. They're also strapped to a vibration table and rattled according to computer-programmed frequencies, ""maybe a Metallica song, or maybe an airplane vibration modal spectrum,"" Clark said. In separate containers on airport grounds, Beta's electric motors spin on 13 testing devices called dynamometers to gauge their durability.

""We just beat the shit out of motors continuously,"" Clark said.

The company's first-things-first approach is beginning to pay off. Since its unveiling last June, Alia has undertaken some of the most advanced flight testing in the industry and now regularly flies 100-mile practice routes over Chittenden County. Last week, the U.S. Air Force granted Alia approval to fly on behalf of the military, only the second electric aircraft authorized to do so.

In April, Beta signed a deal to sell at least 10 of its roughly $4 million aircraft to United Parcel Service by 2024; UPS says it will use them on some of its regional express delivery routes, flying packages between warehouses instead of airports. Beta's also committed to delivering up to 20 planes to Blade, a company that currently offers $800 helicopter rides from Manhattan to the Hamptons. Beta's workforce has grown from 75 employees a year ago to more than 230 and counting, as the company plans a big push toward flight certification and production.

On the cusp of pioneering commercial electric aviation, Beta could quickly become one of Vermont's largest companies if it can successfully compete in a new global market. Clark and his wife, Katie, met in middle school in Essex and dream of their community becoming a ""green aviation stronghold."" But the startup is far from alone in its quest, and its flurry of achievements comes as competitors have raked in gobs of investor cash — more than $4 billion in 2021 so far.

Beta raised $143 million in new private capital in March and was in the process of raising $190 million more, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure filed April 1 but unreported until now. Some industry analysts believe the cost to bring a new plane to market is even greater, but they nonetheless consider Beta a top contender because of its tangible progress in a speculative industry.

""It's a program that's more likely to make it than others,"" said Brian Foley, a longtime aerospace consultant, offering a levelheaded assessment. ""But it's still, like many of them, somewhat precarious.""

'You're On'

Oliver Parini

Kyle Clark

Clark, 41, has been imagining different ways of flying for a long time. As a senior at Harvard University in 2004, he exuded confidence when his thesis project was named best in his engineering class. The young airplane and motorcycle enthusiast built a flight simulator based on a motorcycle chassis that could more intuitively match the roll and pitch pilots experience while flying. ""I have every intention of taking this project through to completion,"" he told the university's newswire, the Harvard Gazette.

By ""completion,"" Clark meant producing a functional aircraft that the pilot can roll a sport bike into, use it to pilot the plane, and upon landing ride it out — in other words, a flying motorcycle. ""The feasibility study is complete, and the concept is indeed realistic,"" he was quoted as saying.

The project didn't materialize, nor did his other ambition, professional hockey. The Washington Capitals drafted the Harvard winger in 1999. He played a couple of seasons on its minor league affiliates but proved a better enforcer than goal scorer.

The Clarks moved back to Vermont, where Kyle cofounded iTherm Technologies, a maker of induction heating power supplies, in Colchester. He sold the company to Dynapower in South Burlington and became that company's director of engineering, working on power electronics and battery systems. He and another Dynapower alum later started Designbook, now Venture.co, as a social networking and investment-seeking platform for tech entrepreneurs. Kyle's collegiate ""cycleplane"" concept resurfaced as the example he liked to use of a business venture that could benefit from Designbook.

In March 2017, Clark was giving a presentation on batteries for an aviation company in Philadelphia when someone in the audience stopped him. ""Who are you, and why are you here?"" Clark recalled being asked.

His interrogator was Martine Rothblatt, the author, entrepreneur and futurist who is one of the more interesting rich people in the world. Rothblatt, who has a home in Vermont, founded Sirius Satellite Radio and, after her daughter was diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension, started the now-publicly traded biotechnology company United Therapeutics to cure her disease. As a trans woman, Rothblatt has advocated for the rights of trans and gender-nonconforming people. She and her wife, Bina Aspen, launched the Terasem Movement, a group of educational and religious organizations that seek to transplant human consciousness through technology and that operate out of Lincoln. One of Terasem's projects involved replicating Bina as an artificial intelligence robot named Bina48.

Rothblatt took note of Clark's enthusiasm and their shared Vermont ties and invited him for coffee the next time she was around. She wanted to know how he would go about developing an electric aircraft, Clark said.

Electric aviation was having a moment. In October 2016, the ride-hailing giant Uber issued a white paper that laid out a vision for a network of on-demand, pilotless electric air taxis within a decade. The small aircraft would be able to take off from and land on helipads atop buildings, shortening urban commutes.

Rothblatt, a helicopter pilot, was exploring electric flight, as well, but for her own reasons. She wanted a fleet of carbon-neutral aircraft that could transport the human organs that United Therapeutics hopes to manufacture before 2030. She'd worked with a team of California engineers in 2016 to test fly a conventional helicopter retrofitted with a rechargeable battery. That same year, United Therapeutics subsidiary Lung Biotechnology invested $10 million in a Chinese startup, EHang, that is developing eVTOL planes. But Rothblatt was still looking to place another bet. She was in Philadelphia that day, she told Seven Days, to hear from another company that was looking into the technology; Clark was there as one of its potential contractors.

""It's kind of my nature as a technologist to always have multiple shots on goal,"" she said.

Clark struck Rothblatt as having the ""perfect mixture"" of the skills she was looking for: ""somebody who completely understands how to build and execute businesses for electric power,"" she recalled, ""and somebody who is also a pilot and completely understands flying.""

Their coffee date turned into a daylong visit and a request that Clark put some ideas in writing, he recalled. He returned to his Underhill home and drew up a business proposal, accenting it with watercolors to make it pop. The document, which he sent her at 4 a.m. the next day, asked United Therapeutics to put up $1.5 million in initial funding while Clark would contribute an equivalent value toward a rather conceptual goal: ""elicit critical thinking in electric aviation.""

Later that morning, he recalled, Rothblatt texted him: ""You're on.""

Rothblatt's backing helped Beta bring other investors and advisers aboard, including Dean Kamen, the New Hampshire-based creator of the Segway; Stone Point Capital CEO and Vermont native Charles Davis; and Boston Scientific cofounder and Shelburne resident John Abele. Clark was able to recruit top Vermont talent, including Steve Arms, founder of Williston sensor maker MicroStrain, who joined Beta in its first year. Clark also tapped locals, such as Ben Colbourn, who said he was working in Burlington's Generator maker space when Clark called looking for anyone knowledgeable about drones. Colbourn now oversees Beta's 3D printers, making sophisticated shapes from specialty materials at a rapid pace.

Early on, Clark approached Burlington International Airport in search of space for his startup. Airport director of aviation Gene Richards agreed to lease an aging hangar used by maintenance staff in exchange for repairs and improvements. To run flight tests, Beta also leased space across Lake Champlain at Plattsburgh International Airport, site of a former U.S. Air Force base.

Within 10 months, Beta's small team had designed, built and hovered its first eVTOL prototype in virtual secrecy. Ava, a somewhat spindly craft that wielded eight tilting propellers, served as a demonstration project. Its successful hover testing reeled in a $48 million contract from Rothblatt's company.

Once Ava was aloft, Clark said, he sent his first investor and potential customer sketches of what would become Alia. More importantly, Clark said, he pitched Rothblatt on his approach to making an aircraft that would have real-world use.

""It is focusing really deep into the motors, batteries, inverters, and being relatively conventional on the stuff that doesn't deserve innovation quite yet,"" he said late last month. ""The materials science, the interiors, the avionics, the flight controls — those things are not going to take us from guzzling fuel in a jet engine to a new form of aviation. But the electric propulsion is.""

Lift and Cruise

Commercial air travel accounts for roughly 3 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The relatively small figure is expected to grow, and unlike the auto industry, aviation hasn't had a clear path to renewable alternatives.

Electric flight is limited by both the amount of energy today's batteries can store relative to their weight — far less than jet fuel — and the immense power that aircraft need their propulsion systems to deliver to stay in the air.

Advancements in battery technology and the efficiency of electric motors in recent years have made electric-powered flight more plausible for small aircraft capable of carrying light loads for relatively short distances.

""The amount of power density you can get at any one time is better than it has been before, and the amount of power you need is less than it has been before,"" said Nicholas Roy, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""So if the question is, 'Well, why now?,' it's the convergence of those two things. Do I think it has converged enough to really make this viable? That I don't know.""

Beta has designed its electric propulsion system from the ground up. Alia uses powerful and efficient permanent magnet motors, the same family of motors used in today's electric cars. Clark said the company's 400-horsepower motors, which are air-cooled and don't require a gearbox, are capable of converting about 95 percent of electric energy into thrust.

""This is our core technology internally,"" Clark said as he showed off the motor's components.

Circuit boards for the inverters that control the motors are also designed in-house, while employees assemble massive battery packs from lithium-ion cells in a series of shipping containers next to the hangar.

Beta's decision to develop its own propulsion components distinguishes it from many of its competitors, who have partnered with legacy aviation firms such as Rolls-Royce and Safran, said Foley, the aviation analyst.

Alia's design takes advantage of Beta's in-house propulsion expertise. Whereas Ava, like many of the air taxis in development, used tiltable propellers to lift vertically and move forward, Alia has separate systems for lift and cruise that use motors specifically designed for each function. The design reflects Clark's emphasis on pragmatic thinking. ""Real innovation happens as you say, 'How do I get that performance without increasing complexity?'"" he said.

Alia is one of the largest, heaviest and most aerodynamic eVTOL designs to be built, said Mike Hirschberg, executive director of the Vertical Flight Society, a nonprofit industry educational group. Simplicity isn't typically a marker of strong performance in aviation, Hirschberg said, ""but I think Beta has a nice balance."" He considers the company one of the leading eVTOL developers, out of more than 200 who have put forward designs.

Last year, Beta got permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to begin initial test flights for Alia within a designated patch of airspace around the Plattsburgh airport.

Clark, who also serves as one of Beta's four test pilots, flew the prototype off airport property for the first time on New Year's Day this year. By March, the company had done enough successful testing that the FAA allowed Alia to fly beyond the initial flight area. Another pilot flew the aircraft across Lake Champlain back to BTV, where testing continues almost daily.

Most of the flight testing so far has been in fixed-wing mode, with the lift propellers detached and wheels installed under the fuselage. Alia had completed its 101st fixed-wing flight on the day that Clark took Seven Days for a tour of the hangar. Publicly available flight data from FlightAware tracked the aircraft flying more than 90 miles back and forth over Essex at a peak altitude of 5,900 feet and a top speed of 150 miles per hour.

Beta is one of the first companies working with the U.S. Air Force through an unusual public-private program intended to accelerate eVTOL development. Launched in 2020, Agility Prime makes Department of Defense funding and resources available to eVTOL developers and helps the Air Force evaluate whether the new forms of aircraft may have military applications. Knowing a homegrown company was working in the field, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) helped funnel an extra $25 million into Agility Prime last year, his office said. The Air Force conducted ground tests on Alia last year to help establish its airworthiness, while Beta installed immersive flight simulators in Springfield, Ohio, and Washington, D.C., so officials can explore scenarios in which the aircraft might be useful.

With the military airworthiness authorization granted to Alia last month, the company can now conduct flight tests on the Air Force's dime as part of a contract that will pay Beta up to $44 million, Clark said. In a press release, Air Force Col. Nathan Diller said Beta's progress ""shows the high level of maturity"" of the company and emerging eVTOL technology.

Not everyone is sold. Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Virginia-based aerospace and defense analyst Teal Group, isn't necessarily skeptical about the progress in electric-aviation technology. He just thinks the notion that today's electric aircraft developers are revolutionizing travel is absurd.

Aboulafia is amused by what he considers an increasingly collective amnesia about the lessons of aviation's past. At the turn of the millennium, Eclipse Aviation, a dot-com-era darling, attracted hundreds of millions in investment to develop superlight, inexpensive personal jets that promised to democratize flight. The jets, it turned out, were not so cheap to make, and the company collapsed with $1 billion in debt.

To Aboulafia, today's ventures seem awfully familiar. Electric air taxi proponents, he argues, are overstating the market for a product that's still incredibly expensive to build. Helicopters are a niche industry, and it's hard to see electric equivalents — even though they are quieter and cheaper to maintain — expanding the market as dramatically as tech futurists and the people who give them money imagine.

""This is a recipe for carnage,"" he said. ""Absolute carnage.""

The last few months have seen a massive acceleration in funding for flying car startups, according to Robin Riedel, a more bullish analyst for McKinsey & Company. The consulting firm has tracked more than $4 billion in eVTOL investment so far in 2021, far more than last year or the $1 billion that was publicly disclosed in 2019.

Most of the recent capital has been provided through Wall Street's latest craze: special-purpose acquisition companies. SPACs, sometimes called blank-check companies, are publicly traded shells that exist solely to find a private company with which to merge. In the last couple of years they've become attractive as shortcuts to a traditional public offering. Three eVTOL makers have used the tool since February to raise as much as $1.6 billion each.

McKinsey projects that the global market for passenger eVTOL flights could be at least $300 billion annually. Others have estimated even larger revenue potential. ""The investments that are going into this are reasonable,"" Riedel said, ""if that is actually the market.""

All that cash is crucial for startups to get a new kind of aircraft certified by the FAA and into production for commercial flight, which likely would cost more than $750 million, several analysts told Seven Days. Some eVTOL makers have said they can get it done within the next two to three years.

Clark asserts that Beta doesn't need as much money as the other companies because it has a clearer, quicker path to regulatory approval and a more straightforward business model. Unlike some other companies, Beta isn't trying to also establish a new passenger airline — it's just selling aircraft.

Asked during an interview in late April whether he was considering taking the company public to raise more money, Clark said that doing so would bring a ""whole boatload of disadvantages,"" namely the requirement to communicate with public investors.

""We have the fortunate advantage of only having to convince our customers and the FAA that we have a safe, reliable aircraft that serves our mission,"" he said. ""Not only do you get deposits and down payments from the customers, but you get credibility with alternative sources of funds.""

Though Alia can be outfitted for pilotless urban travel, Beta is working primarily with UPS and United Therapeutics for regional piloted flights. Clark expects that the barriers to using the aircraft for cargo will be significantly lower. Its contract with UPS has an option to expand to 150 aircraft; Rothblatt said her company is seeking to deploy 60 aircraft in 2026.

eVTOL developers focusing on cargo uses have yet to attract investors to the same degree as those working on passenger applications, Riedel noted. Part of the reason is that planes are currently a small part of logistics and shipping businesses; the time they save usually isn't worth the cost.

""The cargo case really requires much more of a shift that is unknown,"" he said.

United Therapeutics is looking for planes that can fulfill organ delivery missions, but Rothblatt said the company's primary interest in eVTOL designs stems from its commitment to sustainability.

""It's no sense for us to be saving people's lives with organ transplants if we're trashing the whole world environment,"" she said.

Of her several bets on eVTOL, Rothblatt said Beta is poised to offer the longest flight range with a feasible route to certification.

""Kyle has designed a path for Beta which is challenging to get the FAA certification but definitely doable,"" she said. ""And when he gets it, his aircraft will have the best performance characteristics, in my opinion, of any of the others.""

Building Out

Rothblatt's backing, Clark said, has allowed him to design the company according to his own vision, with a culture to reflect it.

Some aspects of Beta's organizational ethos can seem like tech startup gimmicks. Beta's many job postings seek engineers and technicians but also ""gurus"" and ""ninjas."" Yet once they join the company, employees refer to their job titles almost universally as ""teammate."" Clark insists there's merit to the idea. For example, taking time off doesn't hinge on supervisor approval but on teammates' agreement that the absence of a fellow worker won't leave them in the lurch.

The result is a cadre of entrepreneurial employees who, Clark said, ""just care a whole hell of a lot about what they're doing, as opposed to a bunch of people that are trying to follow instructions or conform to something or climb the corporate ladder.""

Since the beginning, Beta has encouraged all of its ""teammates"" to attain a pilot's license on company time under the tutelage of its several certified instructors. More than 30 have licenses, and 100 more are in training. The program has helped instill broader affection for and understanding of aviation, which leads, Clark believes, to smarter design.

Katie Clark oversees marketing, though she recently refashioned the marketing meetings as ""band practice"" to avoid boxing in their thinking. She hired a local chef to make lunch each day for the growing staff, who on a recent Wednesday stood in the rain for lunch at the company food truck. Katie and Kyle's four children, whom they homeschool, spend a lot of time at the office, too. Their 18-year-old daughter, Willa, has been working at Beta since she was 16. She said she started flying planes before she learned to drive.

As flight testing continues, the company is also gearing up to attain FAA certification and to manufacture Alia. Last fall Beta hired Matt Cherouny, a 35-year-old manufacturing engineer, to assess how to bring Alia into production. Cherouny grew up in South Burlington, attended the University of Vermont and worked for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters before going to work for Tesla in California several years ago. He's one of many Beta engineers who earned their degrees in Vermont.

""Visiting Beta made me realize I can move back to Vermont and I don't have to sacrifice my career and my personal beliefs"" about sustainability, Cherouny said. He piloted his first solo flight last month, which was celebrated according to aviation tradition: by cutting off a piece of the shirt he was wearing.

Beta has not yet decided where to set up manufacturing operations, though it may well be at BTV. Vermont Business Magazine recently quoted a local contractor who said the company was eyeing a manufacturing facility there. Airport director Richards said Beta has an option to expand onto an open, nearly 40-acre parcel at the south end of the property. He confirmed ""informal negotiations"" with Beta about using it.

Clark's goal, he said, is to continue growing the business in Vermont, the home state of both his family and more than half of Beta's employees. He sees advantages to locating manufacturing operations near the engineering, so long as it also makes business sense. ""Obviously, that requires everything from local community support to political support to financial reasons to make all that happen,"" he said.

Public officials are eager to help. Beta was approved over the winter for a Vermont Employment Growth Incentive payment of up to $2.8 million, according to state records. Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said in an interview that Beta is on track to have a ""very significant economic impact"" in the region doing work that dovetails with the city's climate priorities. ""We will work hard to make the opportunity right when Beta is ready to make that decision,"" he said.

After Leahy visited Beta last week, a spokesperson said he will urge Congress to consider boosting the country's electric aircraft industry through President Joe Biden's proposed infrastructure bill.

""Beta has a very bright future,"" Leahy said in a statement, ""and I want that future to be based right here in Vermont.""

In the meantime, Beta is laying the literal groundwork to support its vision of electric flight. Like electric cars, an electric air network requires places to charge.

The company has devised an all-in-one landing and recharging system that can be installed at airports, warehouses and other locations. The units can charge any kind of electric vehicle and use battery banks to limit how much energy is pulled from the grid at any given time. Alia can be recharged in less than an hour, Beta says.

The company has already built out a network of recharging stations from Burlington to Springfield, Ohio, through small airports in western New York State that will enable Alia to make a longer trek. Clark plans to expand the network up and down the East and West coasts and eventually establish landing and recharging infrastructure nationwide.

A Beta-funded project to electrify Rutland's airport was under way last month, state aviation manager Dan Delabruere said. Some regional governments are already considering pursuing federal funds to add infrastructure to support electric aircraft.

The recharging stations, constructed in Williston, feature a landing deck perched above four containers that provide resting quarters, battery supply and a repair shop. The interior spaces are created from recycled shipping containers — a characteristically resourceful touch.

The station at BTV is visible along Airport Drive to motorists heading to the airport terminal. It looks cool, if a little provisional. Most people probably didn't imagine flying cars would be parked atop salvaged steel boxes. But Beta's clunky pads could be where that future finally gets off the ground.",Flight Path: BTV’s Beta Technologies Is on the Cusp of a Breakthrough for Electric Aviation,,
8,https://evtolinsights.com/2021/05/beta-technologies-alia-evtol-aircraft-receives-military-airworthiness-approval-from-us-air-force/,"BETA Technologies has been awarded airworthiness approval for a manned electric aircraft by the US Air Force’s Agility Prime programme, with its ALIA eVTOL aircraft having already begun flying under the air force’s operational flight test program.

The U.S. Air Force spent more than a year assessing ALIA, conducting deep dives into engineering, operations and flight test capabilities against the demanding military 516c standard. Subject matter experts evaluated every aspect of ALIA for safety, design, and maintenance standards, as well as participated in the flight test campaign planning.

Under this contract, the air force will have access to the only manned, 7,000-pound class all-electric aircraft known to be flying in the world today. With this kind of open access and evaluation of operational test results, air force acquisition officials will be able to make data driven procurement decisions to best meet the military’s technical needs and will be informed by real assessments of military utility in the field.

In addition to field and real-life applications in the aircraft flight test program, BETA’s flight simulation and training facilities allow Air Force pilots and engineers to experience the future of eVTOL aircraft by rehearsing and testing ALIA in a variety of potential mission sets and scenarios.

Col. Nathan Diller, Director of AFWERX at the United States Air Force, said: “Achieving the first manned airworthiness authorization in the Agility Prime program is a key milestone. This not only unlocks the opportunity to begin Air Force directed manned flight tests, but it also shows the high level of maturity of this technology and the high level of maturity of Agility Prime partner companies like BETA.”

Agility Prime is designed to leverage and accelerate commercial innovation efforts. In a first of its kind arrangement, AFRL engineers used unique equipment and analysis capabilities to conduct Ground Vibration Testing (GVT), a method of dynamic structural analysis on ALIA. This valuable data provided by the GVT will be used to safely advance the flight test programme safely while providing valuable insight to the US Air Force on novel aircraft design.

The advanced urban air mobility technology simulator near the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) in Springfield, Ohio, also provides easy access to the Air Force’s technical acquisition workforce, while the Washington, D.C. test facility provides an ideal venue to immerse senior leaders and decision makers in the electrified future. These state-of-the-art simulators are physics based and include weather, emergency handling, battle damage, and advanced mission scenario simulation.

Kyle Clark, BETA’s Founder and CEO, said: “Electric aviation is a National Security priority and fortunately this was recognized early by the Air Force. The speed and efficiency of the Air Force Agility Prime program to support sustainable electric aviation has been remarkable. The people and expertise that the Air Force has brought to the electric aviation industry and specifically our ALIA program is accelerating the development of incredibly capable, safe and reliable aircraft.”

Last month, BETA advanced to the next phase of its flight-testing programme, completing an interstate flight with ALIA from Plattsburgh, New York to Burlington International Airport in South Burlington, Vermont.

In accordance with FAA protocols regarding the ability of experimental aircraft to fly beyond a designated test area, BETA had to complete comprehensive testing to ensure reliable and predictable aircraft handling and performance. In the same week ALIA flew its first interstate flight, the aircraft set a new BETA record for endurance, range, and altitude.

BETA will continue testing aircraft capabilities and mission applicability including range, altitude, endurance and payload limits before testing specific cargo, logistic and other missions.

The quiet electric propulsion has a very low thermal and acoustic signature, enabling the aircraft to complement existing ground and air vehicles with new capabilities. Cost, maintainability and availability will be tracked and evaluated during operational test and evaluation. All of these benefits come with zero operational emissions, an important part of the Armed Forces sustainability goals.

Recently, BETA added to its growing customer list securing agreements with BLADE and UPS for its ALIA aircraft and charging stations.

Expanding Customer Base

With today's news, Blade Urban Air Mobility becomes BETA's first passenger service partner, securing up to 20 of the first passenger-configured ALIA EVAs for purchase by its network of operators and third-party financing partners, with delivery scheduled to begin in late 2024. BETA's ALIA aircraft will have a 250 nautical mile range with a cruising speed of up to 170 miles per hour. Blade's service with ALIA will begin on select routes using Blade's existing private terminal infrastructure. These aircraft will be deployed for a diverse set of mission profiles to and from city centers across multiple geographies.

In addition to today's passenger service news, BETA's technological capability across commercial, defense and cargo applications has been validated by a diverse customer mix.

BETA's first customer and partner, United Therapeutics, will rely on BETA's aircraft to deliver organs for human transplantation.

Last week, UPS announced it reserved the right to purchase 150 of BETA's aircraft, with the first 10 to be delivered beginning in 2024. UPS also purchased BETA's charging stations as part of an integrated solution.

The United States Air Force continues to participate in the BETA flight test campaigns as a part of its innovative USAF Agility Prime program, which marshals government resources to accelerate commercialization of air mobility vehicles.

ALIA: Simple, Clean, Quiet

BETA's ALIA aircraft includes a novel combination of elements that create a smooth, quiet flying experience, with applications for moving both people and cargo, all while producing zero operational emissions. ALIA will be capable of flying 250 nautical miles on a single charge and carrying six people or three standard cargo pallets and a pilot. Charging will be completed in less than 50 minutes. While flying, the aircraft will be more than 10x quieter than a helicopter, imperceptible over normal urban noise and quieter than cars on a highway.

BETA's Commitment to Sustainability and an Electric Aviation Ecosystem

The aviation industry currently accounts for nine percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and is forecasted to account for the majority by 2035 if companies like BETA don't make a meaningful dent in aircraft emissions. With Blade and others in the transportation and logistics companies pledging to reach net zero emissions within the next 20 years, BETA's aircraft offer a clear path to achieving these goals.

BETA is focused on sustainability. The Company is building not only a zero operational emissions aircraft, but a full electric powered aviation ecosystem.

BETA has the largest aviation charging network in the world, extending throughout the northeast United States , and sites are underway across America, with plans to expand it rapidly. These high-speed charging stations allow aircraft to charge at airports, or land on an elevated deck and charge while crew and passengers access a lounge below, complete with work space and sleeping accommodations. Recharging takes less than an hour and can be accomplished in both on- and off-airport locations.

Enhances UPS network flexibility, benefits healthcare providers and small and medium-sized businesses.

Flexible, sustainable solution to reduce air network emissions; recharging station can also be used with electric-powered ground vehicles.

Atlanta, GA

UPS, together with its UPS Flight Forward subsidiary, plans to purchase electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft from Beta Technologies (BETA) to augment its air service for select small and mid-size markets. These aircraft will take off and land on-property at UPS facilities in a whisper-quiet fashion, reducing time-in-transit, vehicle emissions, and operating cost.

The BETA aircraft’s 1,400-pound cargo capacity is ideally suited to more quickly and sustainably transport time-sensitive deliveries that would otherwise fly on small fixed-wing aircraft. UPS’s use of the aircraft will benefit healthcare providers, thousands of small and medium-sized businesses, and other companies in smaller communities. With a 250-mile range and cruising speed of up to 170 miles per hour, UPS will be able to plan a series of short routes, or one long route, on a single charge to meet customers’ needs.

“This is all about innovation with a focus on returns for our business, our customers, and the environment,” said UPS Chief Information and Engineering Officer Juan Perez. “These new aircraft will create operational efficiencies in our business, open possibilities for new services, and serve as a foundation for future solutions to reduce the emissions profile of our air and ground operation.”

The aviation industry is focusing on small aircraft, which UPS uses to serve many small and medium-sized communities, to develop groundbreaking, sustainable electric-powered aircraft. BETA’s aircraft has four fixed vertical lift propellers and one pusher propeller for forward flight. It can charge in an hour or less, and produces zero operational emissions.

“We’re combining simple, elegant design and advanced technology to create a reliable aircraft with zero operational emissions that will revolutionize how cargo moves,” said BETA founder and CEO Kyle Clark. “By utilizing vertical takeoffs and landings, we can turn relatively small spaces at existing UPS facilities into a micro air feeder network without the noise or operating emissions of traditional aircraft.”

UPS has also reserved BETA's recharging station for a seamless and fully integrated electric aviation system. The BETA charging station helps ensure safe and rapid charging of the aircraft in under one hour, and facilitates a quick turn for the loading and unloading of cargo. The charging station also offers the aircraft’s batteries a second life cycle.

After the batteries’ first life cycle in the aircraft concludes, they can be fitted to the charging stations to recharge the aircraft’s onboard batteries as well as UPS’s fleet of electric ground vehicles. UPS currently operates more than 12,000 alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles, and announced a commitment to purchase up to 10,000 Arrival electric vehicles.

BETA’s aircraft are designed to someday operate autonomously as technologies and regulations are established. UPS Flight Forward received the first U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 135 Standard air carrier certification to operate a drone airline, and is operating daily revenue-generating flights with drones. The FAA certification also enables UPS Flight Forward to fly payloads of up to 7,500 lbs. either with an operator or autonomously.

Last month, BETA advanced to the next phase of flight testing, completing an interstate flight from its Plattsburgh, NY test facility to its Burlington, Vt. headquarters. In accordance with FAA protocols for experimental aircraft to fly beyond its home airport, BETA had to complete rigorous testing to ensure reliable and predictable behavior of the aircraft. In the same week, the company set a new personal-best in range while also reaching 8,000 feet in altitude.

The first ten BETA aircraft are scheduled to begin arriving in 2024, with an option to purchase up to 150 of the aircraft.

In reality, that’s a much bigger deal.

Beta Technologies’ Alia in flight above Lake Champlain on March 16. Eric Adams Photo

The achievement on Wednesday, in which Beta’s Alia-250 prototype made a flight from its primary test location in Plattsburgh, New York, across Lake Champlain to the company’s headquarters in nearby Burlington, Vermont, has practical significance in addition to being a meaningful moment for the company’s nearly 200 engineers, designers, fabricators, and other team members. The Federal Aviation Administration doesn’t allow experimental aircraft to fly beyond their base airports until they’re proven stable enough to do so, so Wednesday’s mission represents that achievement and a closing of the initial phase of flight test.

In order to qualify for the multi-airport flight, executed by test pilot Camron “Arlo” Guthrie, who climbed to 8,000 feet before crossing the lake in sunny, chilly early-morning conditions, Beta had to validate Alia’s reliable and predictable behavior during takeoffs and landings, but also its stall characteristics, upset recovery abilities, glide performance, and controllability across other key phases of flight.

Company founder, CEO, and chief test pilot Kyle Clark said that the company added its own requirements along the way. Beta airlifted Alia to Plattsburgh last June after several months of tethered hover tests and began a rigorous flight test program in New York. The engineers validated the lift-over-drag ratio and the propulsion system’s thrust-to-weight ratio, conducted taxi tests, and studied how the aircraft handles at or near the stall point, Clark said.

“That’s really important because you have to come near that every time you transition onto the rotors for vertical flight,” he said.

In accordance with Beta’s test philosophy, the plan was to first hover the aircraft, then go fly it solely in conventional forward flight, nudging it toward the slowest possible flight on the fixed wing, and then move back to hover testing as they progress toward full eVTOL transitions.

“We’ve painted the ends of the envelope now and brought the fixed wing back to the slow condition,” Clark said. “Now it’s time to bring Alia back to our research and development center here in Vermont.”

Production versions of Alia will enter service first in commercial, industrial, and military applications — as a cargo, utility, and transport aircraft — before moving into the consumer air taxi realm. Alia will now travel back and forth between the two airports occasionally as testing continues and within a few weeks have its top rotors reinstalled for vertical flight tests.

Alia makes the flight from Plattsburgh, New York, to the company’s headquarters in Burlington, Vermont, one of many milestone test flights in recent weeks. Eric Adams Photo

This week’s milestone comes with a variety of other recent achievements for the company. Not only did Alia reach 8,000 feet altitude during recent flights, it also set a new personal-best in range — a number the company isn’t ready to disclose at this time. (The straight-line distance between Plattsburgh and Burlington is only 18 miles/29 kilometers, but the flight involved a steady circular climb to 8,000 feet before crossing, then an orbit above Burlington International Airport. The mission was easily completed with just three battery packs installed, of five possible, and took 50 minutes.)

Beta expects Alia to have a maximum range of 250 miles (400 km), including a vertical takeoff and a vertical landing.

Beta is also nearing completion of its second composite-built prototype and it recently joined a handful of eVTOL manufacturers to be admitted to the General Aviation Manufacturer’s Association. Clark noted that this is in response to the eVTOL movement’s focus on commercializing the aircraft, which GAMA supports.

While flight test is the largest part of the company’s daily operations, it’s also working hard on what Clark calls its “ground game” — the development and installation of charging stations that will allow the company’s aircraft to begin cross-country flights.

“We just completed our network that goes from here in Vermont, across the top of New York, across the top Pennsylvania, and all the way down into Ohio to near Wright Patterson Air Force Base,” he said. “So we’ve completed that network, and we have now a facility at the Springfield, Ohio, airport with a full immersive simulator for the Air Force.”

This is in support of the Air Force’s Agility Prime initiative, which the branch is using to help ensure that the next generation of aerospace technologies grow in the United States rather than abroad. Beta has set up a similar simulator and charging pad near Washington, D.C.

Clark said pursuing all these channels helps make the new technology commercially viable.

“Describing the air taxi market in detail, with passengers coming into vertiports that are 18 stories tall, is very understandable, but it’s not the problem that needs to be solved today,” he added. “There’s still nobody who has certified or is commercially operating an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, so the problem that does need to be solved today is to make intensely reliable propulsion systems and put them into really smart aircraft configurations. That’s what we’re focused on.”",Beta scores multiple milestones in quiet pursuit of electric flight,,

Other new members include Airbus Corporate Jets, Hartzell Engine Technologies, and supply chain management provider Incora, according to a press release from GAMA.

The presence of eVTOL companies within the manufacturing association has increased dramatically as the sector has inched closer to certification and operations. Pamela Cohn, chief operating officer for Hyundai’s urban air mobility division, and Wisk CEO Gary Gysin were both recently selected as board members of the manufacturing association.

In early March, GAMA also applauded the introduction of legislation into both houses of the U.S. Congress that would bolster national support for advanced air mobility. The organization has played a key role in lobbying on behalf of the nascent industry at the federal level.

On Mar. 15, GAMA announced the new co-chairs of the Propulsion and Innovation committee to be JoeBen Bevirt, founder and CEO of Joby Aviation, and Roei Ganzarski, CEO of MagniX and executive chairman of Eviation — two leaders in vertical and fixed-wing applications of electric propulsion, respectively.

by CB Hall, Vermont Business Magazine Estimates place aviation's share of the blame for global warming at about 3.5 percent, measured in terms of the differential between incoming energy and the energy radiated back to space as a result of greenhouse gas emissions.

That 3.5 percent may not seem like much, but, according to ourworldindata.org, the volume of aviation-borne carbon-dioxide emissions has increased by 4 to 5 percent yearly since 2010, while aviation's share of total carbon-dioxide emissions from all sources has likewise been increasing.

It's not a pretty picture.

In a hangar at Burlington International Airport, and in a factory in Williston, however, Beta Technologies is going full speed ahead with design work and manufacturing that could provide an alternative – albeit a limited one – to petroleum-powered air travel.

Beta's engineering team is striving to win a race to develop an electrically powered zero-emissions aircraft.

In a recent interview with VBM, founder and CEO Kyle Clark said that the first applications of Beta's electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing (eVTOL) aircraft will be the transportation of natural and manufactured organs for transplant patients, and a US Air Force cargo and logistics mission.

More tantalizingly, perhaps, the technology will also see some application in passenger transportation.

EVTOL aircraft will not be replacing Boeing and Airbus jumbo jets anytime soon, but, Clark said, “I believe that between 2026 and 2030 we would start to see the bulk of air taxis using electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing aircraft.”

In addition to its facilities in Vermont, Beta leases a 40,000-square-foot hangar at Plattsburgh International Airport, where it has conducted the bulk of test flights for its prototype, named Alia.

[Alia gets a helicopter airlift across Lake Champlain, rather than flying on its own propulsion.]

In a January 19 interview, Clark said that Beta's payroll stood at 177.

Incorporated in 2017, Beta is also increasing its footprint at BTV.

The company has just completed a 14,000-square-foot addition on its hangar there.

Further, Clark reported, “We just got permitted for a 22,000-square-foot addition we're building on the north side of the same hangar, towards the main terminal.”

He also expected expansion at the leased Williston facility, which has been producing recharging systems.

“We put just under one million in leasehold improvements to the facility for our production,” he noted. “We expect to be there indefinitely.”

The plant will also produce unmanned small aircraft that, he said, are “just a little bit smaller and have a different purpose [from the eVTOL]. But that's not our chief focus.”

The Virtues of Simplicity

Funding for the eVTOL's development is coming largely from United Therapeutics, a pharmaceutical and biotech firm based in Maryland and North Carolina.

The mission of UT's Organ Manufacturing Group, according to its website, is “to manufacture an unlimited supply of transplantable organs before the end of the decade.”

That will include both modified organs from pigs and organs constructed in part with 3-D printers.

The high-tech printers also constitute part of operations at Beta, where they turn out “a whole lot of cooling components for electric motors, as well as airfoils and molds for carbon fiber parts,” said Clark, who grew up in Chittenden County and went on to a degree in engineering at Harvard.

Whatever the reliance on space-age manufacturing techniques, however, the engineer-entrepreneur sees design simplicity as a virtue.

Alia uses a direct-drive system to power its propeller and rotors. That means essentially that no gearing modifies the engine's power before it gets to the propeller or rotor.

The design makes Alia – which vaguely resembles a small helicopter – lightweight and more reliable, unburdened as it is by additional failure-prone mechanical components.

But Clark clarified that, unlike a helicopter, Alia doesn't hover. It maintains forward momentum at all times, even during takeoff and landing.

Each of the four “corners” of the aircraft – which weighs only two to three tons – houses a motor to drive the vertical-lift rotors that get the craft off the ground.

Since the motors can run at different speeds, the rotors spin correspondingly, as the circumstances demand. That removes the need for a differential distribution of torque generated by a single motor – again simplifying the overall design of the craft.

It has a range of 288 miles.

Clark pointed to three major advantages that Beta's product will have over today's aircraft.

First, there's the obvious plus of eliminating fossil fuels and thus reducing operational emissions to zero.

That, he stressed, “is a big, important factor for many businesses that have fleets of aircraft.”

He also noted the reduction in maintenance – which, he said, is “massively improved by cold propulsion.”

Then there's operational flexibility, too.

“You can go directly to the hospital or distribution facility,” he explained. “No one likes going to the airport.”

“All those organs have to be transported.”

Alia is the successor to Beta's Ava prototype, which Clark described as a proof-of-concept vehicle.

“It showed that we could fly a distributed-propulsion, all electric, VTOL aircraft... When we successfully did that, we earned a $48 million contract from UT to design a new aircraft, Alia, and we've actually built two of them now.”

UT has also purchased a number of the recharging stations Beta makes in Williston.

“We have a similarly sized contract from the Air Force, and we have two other contracts that I unfortunately can't talk about. And then we have local investors that have put about $53 million into the company while we develop the aircraft.”

He anticipated getting Federal Aviation Administration certification for Alia.

“It'll be about a two-and-a-half- to three-year process, that we've already started, to understand what modifications or changes will be needed for them to accept it. So far it appears that the baseline design is certifiable. It is stable and flies well.”

“We anticipate being able to sell [Alia] to the Air Force in 2022, and to our other customers starting in 2024… The Air Force has a different path to certification, which is a little less friction. It will lead into deploying squadrons of aircraft in 2023.”

He said he expected UT to start flying Alia “between 2025 and 2026. They have anchored on having 60 aircraft deployed in 2026, and 100 aircraft deployed yearly from 2027 onward.”

When VBM expressed surprise at the size of the UT commitment, he noted that thousands of people in the United States die each year while waiting for transplants – about 20 people a day, according to the American Transplant Foundation.

Anywhere from 108 to 120 thousand individuals are waiting for organ transplants at any one time, according to online sources.

According to the United Network for Organ Sharing, about 40,000 transplants are done nationwide each year, meaning that many thousands wind up waiting – and maybe dying.

“All those organs have to be transported,” Clark pointed out that it’s the weak link in the transplant process.

No Public Demonstration Flight - Yet

Beta faces plenty of competition.

Uber, for example, is touting its Uber Elevate program, which “is developing shared air transportation—planned for 2023—between suburbs and cities, and ultimately within cities. We’re working with our Elevate Network partners to launch fleets of small, electric VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft in Dallas, Los Angeles, and Melbourne,” Uber's website reports under the headline “The future of urban mobility.”

Whether the business model will be relevant to a rural state like Vermont, or to applications Clark foresees for Alia, is unclear.

“Each of the major aerospace companies has a program,” Clark said. “We're one of four companies that have flying prototypes, and to my knowledge we're the only company that has meaningful contracts for the use of the aircraft.”

But – VBM asked the obvious question – what of air traffic control, once all those eVTOLs join the array of other flying devices in what once was the exclusive province of birds?

“As the traffic density increases, so will the technology that enables less aircraft separation,” he said. “Both NASA and the FAA have meaningful programs focused on this.”

But while aircraft like Alia show great potential, those who foresee electric aircraft sidelining today's jetliners need a reality check.

“There's a physical limit to what you can do in a VTOL aircraft with this technology,” Clark said. “We have the biggest aircraft in this space right now,” he added.

He anticipated building eVTOL craft with a capacity of “six passengers, maybe up to nine. The problem is you hit regulatory limits pretty quickly. We're not crossing that bridge yet.”

Asked whether eVTOLs will be chargeable at home, much as electric cars are, he likewise expressed some caution.

“Ultimately, yes. We have small chargers in the lab right now, on 240-volt circuits, but it would take a day to charge [the plane] up.”

While a 2019 article on thedrive.com spoke of an “upcoming cross-country flight” to demonstrate the capabilities of Beta's aircraft, such plans have not yet materialized.

“We've done demonstrations ... for our customers,” Clark said. “We haven't done any public demonstration flights.”

Asked when the general public might get a view of Beta's product in action, he said, “Obviously with COVID and everything ... it's an awkward world right now, so I don't know when.”

It can be safely said, though, that a great many people in Vermont and elsewhere are eager to see what Beta's technology will produce.

Estimated reading time 8 minutes, 45 seconds.

On Friday, June 12, Burlington, Vermont-based electric aviation startup Beta Technologies revealed its striking new aircraft, an all-white electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) beauty code-named Alia. The mechanism for the debut was a leisurely — if not downright balletic — helicopter airlift across Lake Champlain to its official testing ground, a former Air Force base in Plattsburgh, New York.

The roughly 30-minute operation saw the sleek, four-rotor airplane — one of the anticipated front-runners in the global race to launch a viable, fully electric VTOL aircraft — suspended 100 feet below a massive Sikorsky S-61N operated by Quebec-based lift specialist Helicarrier. The pair crossed over the northern end of Burlington, with streets along its route blocked off by police, then flew at a stately pace across the lake, usually just a few hundred feet above the surface of the water.

Helicarrier makes quick work of even the most challenging lifts, from refrigeration units in dicey urban environments to industrial machinery. If it’s under 10,000 pounds (4,535 kilograms) and can be attached to a long line, the company will move it for you. But Alia is a different kettle of fish. For starters, it’s a priceless prototype. Being forced to activate the emergency release and dump it in the lake if something went wrong — something Helicarrier has never had to do — would set the program back at least a year.

“For the most part, what we do typically encompasses things like water buckets on fires or salvage recovery of other crashed airplanes,” said pilot Aaron Lighter, who flew the mission with spotter Fred Carrier, the co-owner and president of the company. “It’s not very often we fly brand-new, experimental, multimillion-dollar projects like this. So, yeah, this is outside our scope a little bit. But at the end of the day it’s a piece of equipment on the end of a long line, and we are very capable of getting it there safely.”

Helicarrier’s load experts and Beta’s engineers collaborated closely in the weeks and months leading up to the airlift to ensure the aerodynamically fine-tuned Alia wouldn’t get a mind of her own in transit. That was unlikely, of course, given that Alia’s stall speed is 90 knots, and the airlift would be well below that at 40 knots, but still, the 6,000-lb. (2,720-kg) maximum take-off weight airplane was stripped down to just over 3,000 lb. (1,360 kg), so it had the potential to float a bit if a good gust of wind caught its wide 50-foot (15-meter) wings just so. Add in other aerodynamic qualities designed into the innovative bird, and a simple slow crawl across a lake on a sunny day could become anything but.

To prepare, engineers removed the four hover motors on the airplane’s two outriggers and replaced them with anchor hooks to which the ropes would be attached. Some batteries remained on board to ensure that the fly-by-wire control surfaces could be positioned to help spoil the airplane’s lift. Personnel also removed the pusher motor, which powers horizontal flight, and put tape over the window seams to ensure the Velcro-affixed canopy — something that makes it easily accessible during testing — would stay in place. Finally, the teams ensured the aircraft had a slight, three-degree nose-down attitude when suspended, and they installed a drag chute in the rear of the aircraft to help it remain stable in the wind, allowing it to weathervane as necessary without spinning out of control.",Brawn over brains: How Beta’s new electric aircraft made its first flight by helicopter,,
16,https://www.wired.com/story/new-air-taxi-design-cues-far-flying-bird/,"Air-taxi startup Beta Technologies debuted its new aircraft Friday with a dramatic helicopter airlift of the sleek white model across Lake Champlain from Burlington, Vermont, to Plattsburgh, New York. Code-named Alia, the electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing (eVTOL) airplane is the successor to Ava, a smaller prototype the company used to experiment with propulsion strategies and learn about the tricky aerodynamics of small, electrified, vertical-lift flight.

According to company founder Kyle Clark, Alia’s striking configuration and elegant shape owes a debt to the longest-migrating bird in the world, the Arctic tern. This includes a twin-tail assembly supported by angled trusses, dramatically arched wings, and arcing, tapered wingtips. The tern’s tail configuration and wing stance “proved a great baseline to start from,” Clark says.

For the tern, those features enable ultraefficient, long range flights. Beta hopes for similar performance. Its primary client, United Therapeutics, is developing man-made organs for human transplant and intends to use Beta’s aircraft as an efficient, environmentally friendly distribution system.

Beta didn’t release performance specifications, except to say that it aims to build a prototype that can fly 250 miles and charge in under an hour. Alia has a 50-foot wingspan, and will have a takeoff weight of 6,000 pounds—the prototype airlifted in Vermont on Friday weighed 3,800 pounds, having been stripped of batteries and other heavy components. The craft uses four horizontally mounted rotors for vertical lift and a single rear-facing propeller to boost speed in forward flight. The wide wings will generate lift for more efficient forward flight, instead of relying on the motors to do all of the work as in eVTOL aircraft that derive most of their lift from rotors. It will use existing battery technology and be deployed as part of an ecosystem that includes charging stations in urban centers, at hospitals, or in remote locations to extend the aircraft’s range.

Beyond transporting organs, Beta hopes to expand to commercial applications, cargo, and passenger-carrying air taxis. It is one of two companies, along with Joby Aviation, recently selected by the US Air Force to advance to the next stage of development in its Agility Prime eVTOL program.

The aircraft’s unusual shape will raise eyebrows, but its propulsion strategy is likely to raise even more—in the eVTOL aviation community, anyway. Many eVTOL developers use tilt-rotor systems in which multiple rotors point skyward for takeoff and landing then pitch forward for horizontal flight. Beta used that strategy for Ava, but it proved too complex for the engineers to want to deploy it in a production aircraft. “Our primary objective is to meet our first customer’s mission, reliable organ delivery when and where it’s needed,” Clark says. “We couldn’t have an aircraft that had any possibility of being grounded for repairs due to a complex system.”

Instead of tilt-rotors, Alia uses four fixed rotors on the top of the aircraft and a pusher-prop in the rear to speed forward flight. This strategy required the development of new, ultra-efficient rotors, but they could be optimized for just one job—vertical flight—rather than two. This simplicity will not only make the aircraft more reliable, Beta contends, but also easier to certify and more affordable, because it will have fewer parts, compared with tilt-rotor systems, and lower maintenance costs.",A New Air Taxi Model Takes Design Cues From a Far-Flying Bird,2020-06-12 22:29:13.701000+00:00,

The future of human flight is soaring in a clear direction: electric aviation. That's the assertion of the experts at Beta Technologies, a South Burlington startup that's built what could be one of the most innovative aircraft ever to take to New England skies. Beta's eVTOL, or electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle, combines the flight characteristics of a helicopter, drone and fixed-wing airplane with cockpit and control systems that revolutionize the pilot's interface.

Spoiler alert: That description of the experimental plane, which has already been built and test-flown at New York State's Plattsburgh International Airport, is all the company will reveal publicly before the craft's formal unveiling in 2019. That said, visitors to Beta's booth at this week's Vermont Tech Jam might get the opportunity to see a flight simulator and model cockpit.

Why is Beta's eVTOL in stealth mode? Not to protect trade secrets, said its developers. Currently, both the mainstream media and industry publications publish stories almost daily about eVTOL and electric aircraft, according to Beta's chief operating officer, Tom O'Leary. Given that anticipation is already high, Beta leadership wants to focus on producing a finished product, not on giving tours and interviews.

Still, questions abound: Is the plane being built for a commercial carrier? A cargo company? A car service such as Uber or Lyft? An air ambulance service? The company won't comment, except to say that the craft will be for civilian use and that the project is not funded by venture capital.

Beta's experimental aircraft is the brainchild of company founder Kyle Clark. It's not the first Vermont startup for the 38-year-old engineer, inventor, pilot and entrepreneur. Among his previous projects was Designbook, which helped entrepreneurs launch, develop and crowdsource funding for their projects.

Clark is a motorcycle and aviation enthusiast who designs, builds, drives and flies experimental vehicles of all kinds. He's assembled an all-star team of electrical and mechanical engineers, software designers, and aviation industry experts to build this plane. Launched in the spring of 2017, the project went from initial concept to ""wheels off the ground"" in just 10 months, Clark said. That time trajectory is virtually unheard of in the aviation industry.

""Everything we do is focused on rapid development,"" explained O'Leary, who offered a reporter a peek into the company's headquarters in a Horizon Air hangar at Burlington International Airport. Like others on Beta's team, O'Leary is a tech industry veteran; he previously was chief customer officer at Burlington's Dealer.com and, before that, general manager of sales at what was then Tesla Motors in Palo Alto, Calif.

After walking past a half dozen conventional aircraft, we entered Beta's lab. There sat several scale models of the plane, a battery-charging station and a full-size wooden mockup of the cockpit, outfitted with a virtual reality headset. Clark was taking measurements on one of the scale models, which was about the size of a Ping-Pong table and resembled a huge balsa-wood model plane. Meanwhile, a 3D printer fabricated new parts for the flight deck.

In its effort to produce a viable electric aircraft, Beta's team shows sky-high ambition. This small Vermont-based startup, which just incorporated in July and has 21 full-time employees, aims to soar past other aerospace industry giants, including Boeing, Airbus, NASA and the U.S. military's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. All have been working on battery-powered airplanes for years and have poured tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars into the effort. Early prototypes have already been unveiled, though none is yet in mass production.

What's the company's plan for success in that competitive environment? As O'Leary pointed out, Toyota and General Motors had electric car programs in the works for years before Tesla became the electric car industry leader. As he put it, ""We don't need to unlearn bad habits or ways of thinking about aviation.""

The company can also take advantage of technology that didn't exist a decade ago, O'Leary explained, which makes it possible to bring concepts rapidly from the drawing board to testing. Beta's designers can conceive of a new part in the morning, use CAD software to design it, send it to a 3D printer and implement it on a scale-model prototype the same afternoon.

""Ten years ago,"" O'Leary said, ""that cycle would have taken us a month.""

Consider Beta's combined cockpit and flight deck. Beta hired a Vermont craftsman to build it out of wood in a few days, then plugged off-the-shelf electronics into it and installed other parts hot off the printer.

""Now we have a feel for what this cockpit is going to look like,"" O'Leary said. ""We throw a VR headset on it, and all of a sudden we're experiencing flight in a matter of two months after we designed it.""

The race to develop electric planes reflects a sense that the aviation industry's transition from fossil fuels is long overdue. According to the Environmental Defense Fund, aviation is one of the fastest-growing sources of global greenhouse gases, with the airline industry alone accounting for 2 to 3 percent of all human-created CO2 emissions. If the aerospace industry doesn't alter its current rate of fuel consumption, its greenhouse gas emissions are projected to triple by 2050.

For various reasons, electric-powered propulsion and control systems offer clear advantages over combustion engines, Clark said. The ""energy density,"" or extractable energy, of current battery technology can't yet carry a full-size passenger plane from coast to coast, but it's getting there. Batteries' power and energy efficiency are increasing at a rate of 5 percent per year, Clark said, while those of jet fuel engines have essentially ""flatlined ... so the parity point is coming.""

Electric planes also will be cheaper to operate, Clark added. As of last week, jet fuel was selling for $5.64 per gallon at BTV. ""That 429 out there,"" Clark said, referring to a Bell helicopter in the hangar, ""will cost $3,600 an hour to operate. The aircraft we're developing ... will cost somewhere around $100 an hour.""

Electric motors offer other advantages over combustion engines, Clark continued. Because electric motors have fewer moving parts, they can go dramatically longer between component overhauls: A Beta aircraft can go about 10,000 hours; a conventional helicopter, only 1,000 to 3,000.

And electric aircraft are safer. Without hundreds of gallons of jet fuel on board, a plane is far less likely to catch fire in a crash.

Electric motors excite Clark for another reason: They've enabled him to build a ""fly-by-wire"" system that operates the plane with wired, and even wireless, controls, eliminating the need for mechanical moving parts.

When Clark was getting his bachelor's degree at Harvard University, he was awarded the 2004 Engineering Thesis of the Year for his work on flight dynamics and control algorithms. The control systems in Beta's aircraft, which he's been imagining for 15 years, allow the pilot to operate the plane more intuitively, such as by leaning in one direction or another to steer, bank and climb.

So, has he flown it yet?

""Oh, yeah!"" Clark said with a huge smile. ""That's the grin.""

Clark's contagious enthusiasm for the project has attracted senior tech industry veterans from Vermont and beyond. Steve Arms is founder of what's now LORD Sensing-MicroStrain in Williston, which builds sensors used in everything from bridges to robotics to helicopters. Arms, who sold his company to LORD in 2012, heard about Clark's project via word of mouth and joined the team in November 2017. He's now using sensing technologies and software developed at MicroStrain on Beta's aircraft.

Arms, one of four former MicroStrain people who've joined Beta, described Clark as ""indefatigable"" and a ""roll-up-your-sleeves-and-get-it-done"" kind of guy. ""Kyle can manage so many things at the same time [and] makes it look easy,"" Arms said. ""It's wonderful and very inspiring to the team.""

Another key hire was Artur Adib, a well-known name in Silicon Valley, who was a senior software developer at Twitter and Mozilla and a researcher at New Mexico's Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Adib said he's actually found it advantageous to work in Vermont rather than Silicon Valley. ""You avoid thinking like they do,"" he said. ""If you're constantly surrounded by the same people talking about the same things all the time, there's a lot of groupthink that goes on. We don't have that here.""

Adib cited another advantage to being headquartered in Vermont: easier access to the state's congressional delegation, the airport's leadership and, by extension, its Federal Aviation Administration staff. All of them, he noted, have been extremely supportive of this project.

Both Adib and Arms pointed to a perk of working at Beta: Because all of the team members need to understand the language, mechanics and physics of flight, Clark hired local flight instructors to train them to become licensed pilots. That's a new skill for Arms, though he used to fly with his father in the 1970s and '80s. Climbing aboard the Cessna 172 trainer, he said, was ""like stepping into a time machine. It looked like my dad's plane and even smelled like his plane.""

Vermonters won't get a look at Beta's new aircraft until next year, but O'Leary insisted it will be worth the wait.

""Electric aviation is the inevitable future. It's going to happen gradually over the next five to 50 years, beginning with short flights,"" he said. ""This is an international business opportunity where a small company in Vermont can compete on the same playing field with the big boys.""",Beta Technologies Races to Develop Electric Aviation,,

In one corner of the hangar that will soon become the headquarters for Beta Technologies in Burlington, Vermont—sitting behind an old F-4 Phantom being renovated by the Air Force Reserve—is a vintage Enstrom 28FX helicopter Clark is converting to battery power to evaluate the direct-drive electric motors being installed in the company’s new air taxi prototype. Down the street, at its current HQ, a cabinet of 3-D printers cranks out prototype models and parts, while a collection of battle-scarred flying models of past and future iterations of Beta’s air taxi hang from the walls and ceilings. Across the room, a computer running the high-fidelity flight simulator X-Plane—its creator, Austin Meyers, is part of the team—provides engineers and pilots the chance to evaluate the flight characteristics of the forthcoming aircraft, via a cabin mockup of two seats and three screens.

In another location down yet another street, Beta engineers are working on a solar- and grid-powered recharging pad for e-VTOL aircraft—the electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles Uber and others are betting will start a mobility revolution within the next decade. The idea, Clark says, is that such stations could be set up in key areas so that electric aircraft can recharge between and during missions, even in remote locations. “The re-charging pad is modular and built from recycled shipping containers and reused aircraft batteries,” he said, noting that the stations can be customized to the individual location. “Each shipping container has a specific purpose. Some contain batteries, some contain overnight hotel units, some are maintenance containers, and others contain a control center and pilot briefing room.”

Eric Adams

But it’s actually across Lake Champlain where the hardware gets really interesting. There, at Plattsburgh International Airport—formerly Plattsburgh Air Force Base—the company stores and tests its actual aircraft, the Ava XC. This 4,000-pound, eight-motor, eight-propeller battery-operated e-VTOL aircraft has been in secret development for two years, but was revealed to The Drive during a visit last week. The aircraft uses those eight rotors to allow vertical takeoffs and landing by pointing them 90 degrees up; when pivoted forward, they provide thrust while the 35-foot wing generates lift. The aircraft sits high on tall landing gear, which provide the ground clearance necessary when the propellers pitch forward. It is so far the heaviest known e-VTOL to fly, with more than 170 tests under its belt to date.

Eric Adams

Not only did the company come out of stealth mode this week, but it revealed its funding source and an ambitious demonstration scheduled for this spring or summer. Though the amount invested in Beta remains secret, Clark revealed that his company is funded by United Therapeutics, which is developing manufactured organs for human transplant. Led by technology entrepreneur Martine Rothblatt, founder of SiriusXM satellite radio, the company expects to begin manufacturing its organs around 2024–about the same time that Clark says the production version of his aircraft will be ready.

Eric Adams

Rothblatt sees e-VTOL as the most efficient and economical way to transport organs on-demand. The technology is very close to ready, she said, with battery capacity improving annually. “We’ve seen seven percent improvements in energy density every year for the past several decades,” she said. “We need 300 watt-hours per kilogram in order to reach a range of 250 nautical miles, which is what I’m asking for, and it’s a no-brainer to see that we’ll be there in just a few years.”

Eric Adams

Clark—who's no stranger to Vermont's chill, having once played minor league ice hockey—began his quest even before meeting up with Rothblatt, through work dating back to his college days at Harvard and stretching through a variety of engineering and software startups across the last 15 years. He committed to building Ava when Beta formed in 2017, as a way of “opening up a conversation” about electric aviation. The plan was to fly the aircraft across the country as a way of exposing all the challenges and associated with the work, from performance to regulatory to practical matters such as charging. He assembled a team that included veterans of GE Global Research, Scaled Composites, Tesla, and multiple technology and engineering firms. He even struck up a friendship with Segway inventor Dean Kamen that saw the latter become one of Beta’s key advisors. Now, the vision is all coming together in Burlington and across the lake in Plattsburgh. During several tests last week, Clark flew Ava up and down the 12,000-foot runway, with chase vehicles in hot pursuit. It flew confidently and capably—and much more quietly than I expected. It’s no turbine-powered chopper, but a serene, steady flying machine.

At the moment it appears that Beta is a solid front-runner in the race to e-VTOL glory—though other companies are being as secretive as Beta previously was about their own status. Though the development of the final production aircraft will focus on the specific needs of Rothblatt’s work, Clark is free to also pursue the air-taxi market with his aircraft, as it could easily serve both roles.

Eric Adams

Regardless of the many specific potential uses, he’s passionate about the simple advantages brought by electric aviation. The biggest is reliability: “With many fewer moving parts running at much lower temperatures, electric motors will go for three to 10 times longer before requiring an overhaul,” he said. Another is efficiency. Internal combustion aircraft operate at between 20 and 30 percent efficiency, while electric motors reach 90 to 99 percent efficiency, meaning they can be operated far more economically without emitting any pollution from the aircraft itself. Finally, there’s the pure performance advantage. “Electric motors put out a constant torque across all speeds,” Clark said. “This enables them to be used in a distributed propulsion configuration where the flight controller can demand and expect instantaneous thrust adjustments at any power level.”

Eric Adams

The result: Ultra-precise control no matter the speed or attitude. In fact, e-VTOL aircraft could safely cut power completely—such as to avoid a collision—go into freefall, then restart and recover before hitting the ground. Though such a capability is unlikely to ever be used, as the air-taxi market takes off and similar aircraft enter the skies by the thousands in coming decades, it’ll be a good trick for one to have up the sleeve—just in case.

Eric Adams

The upcoming cross-country flight is meant as both a discovery process—to learn about the capabilities and uncover unknowns—and a demonstration of the technology. To pull it off, Beta will rely on one additional piece of very cool hardware in the hangar: a 1982 Eagle bus. Formerly a musician’s touring vehicle, Clark converted it to a mobile charging platform for Ava. It now has batteries, solar panels, and generators, as well as an expandable landing pad on the roof. Inside, there are bunks and a lounge area for team members to track the flights and troubleshoot along the way.

Around the time of the cross-country journey, Clark will also reveal the final configuration of the production version. Don't expect it to look like Ava, though: It will be completely different from her set-up, as well as faster and capable of flying much further, up to 290 miles—with no bus necessary.","Beta Technologies, a Vermont Air Taxi Start-Up, Might Be About to Change the Aviation World",,

By Elan Head | February 7, 2019 Elan Head | Estimated reading time 16 minutes, 32 seconds. Kyle Clark is an aviation pioneer. That’s not simply because his Burlington, Vermont-based company, Beta Technologies, is among the dozens racing to develop electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft large enough to serve a useful commercial purpose. It is, instead, because he’s one of the handful of people in the world who has actually flown one. Most large eVTOL aircraft (as opposed to personal flying machines) remain in the concept phase. Of the prototypes that have actually flown, most that we know of have done so unmanned. That hasn’t stopped their developers — who are primarily focused on the air taxi market — from hyping them as revolutionary machines that will transform how we move around crowded cities, starting as early as 2023, if Uber’s “Elevate” vision comes to pass. Meanwhile, Clark has been quietly going about the business of flying his own vectored thrust eVTOL demonstrator, dubbed Ava XC. The program is funded by the biotechnology company United Therapeutics, which hopes to eventually use a successor to Ava to transport its manufactured organs — an application that’s much more feasible in the near term than the speculative air taxi market. The aircraft is built around a Lancair ES cabin, with fixed wings and tail provided by the experimental aircraft developer RDD Enterprises. Lightweight carbon fiber outriggers developed by Blue Force Technologies extend from either side of the nose and tail, providing mounting points for four pairs of counter-rotating proprotors, each driven by a pair of 124-horsepower permanent magnet motors. The aircraft can take off vertically with its nacelles pointed 90 degrees toward the sky; then, the nacelles tilt forward as far as zero degrees to the horizontal to direct thrust for forward flight. In cruise, most or all of the lift is generated by the 35-foot (10.7-meter) wing, giving the aircraft the efficiency to make the most of its two lithium-ion battery packs totaling 124 kilowatt-hours. At around 4,000 pounds (1,815 kilograms), Ava is the heaviest known eVTOL to fly to date. And Clark hasn’t just been along for the ride like a passenger in a giant drone. As Beta Technologies’ principal test pilot as well as its founder, he is now more than 180 flights into a rigorous, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved testing program designed to map the edges of the aircraft’s flight envelope, and to demonstrate that it can be landed safety even after motor or battery failures. Clark comes to the role as an engineer and serial entrepreneur who has been passionate about aviation since childhood. He started building his first kit plane, an ultralight, in high school, figuring he could get away with Douglas fir even though the plans called for Sitka spruce. “My mother was frightened I was going to hurt myself with the plane that I was building. She actually burned it, and then, feeling bad about it, set up my first training flight at a local airstrip,” he recalled. Clark studied applied math and materials science at Harvard, where he also played ice hockey. He was drafted by the Washington Capitals, and used his signing bonus for flying lessons. By the time he founded Beta Technologies in 2017, Clark, who is now 39, was an accomplished pilot with airplane multi-engine and instrument ratings. However, he didn’t have any helicopter or test pilot experience, and the FAA wasn’t prepared to sign him off for Ava’s flight test program without those additional qualifications. Rather than hand over the program to another pilot, Clark learned how to fly helicopters, then worked with the FAA to meet the qualifications for a powered lift rating — something that until then had been granted only to pilots with military tiltrotor experience. Now, Beta Technologies also has an approved, simulator-based training program that will allow it to sign off additional powered lift test pilots, “which I believe is unique in the industry,” Clark said.

While Clark is the driving force behind Beta Technologies, he has assembled an impressive team of experts to bring his aircraft to life. Flight simulation is led by Austin Meyer, the creator of the popular flight simulation software X-Plane. Before settling on Ava’s current configuration, Beta Technologies developed 35 variants, all of which were tested in X-Plane using autopilots written by Meyer. “One of the key, interesting things was the number of lines of code it took to write the autopilot was directly proportional to the complexity of controlling the airplane,” Clark observed. “That was a really good metric to say, ‘Yeah, this is or isn’t an elegantly simple design.'” According to Clark, the autopilot developed for Ava has less than 1,000 lines of code, which “basically demands that you are always taking the simplest way of solving the problem.” That, he said, is reflected in the flight controls, which are of hybrid design. A collective lever in the left hand modulates the speed of the proprotors and therefore thrust, although Clark noted that the control is much lighter than a conventional helicopter collective. Traditional foot pedals control the rudder and the clockwise/counter-clockwise differential of the rotors while hovering, and allow for differential braking during ground taxi. In the right hand is a sidestick similar to what might be found in a business jet, which is coupled to both the mechanical flight control surfaces and the fly-by-wire controller for distributed propulsion. The right thumb controls a bump switch that tilts the nacelles, allowing the pilot to modulate the angle as a function of sink rate. “I liken it to a glassy water landing in a sea plane where you come in . . . and all you’re doing is looking at the VSI [vertical speed indicator] and you’re setting your sink rate,” he said. “The same thing’s true when you’re moving this thing forward — if you can feel anything, you know you’re doing something wrong. So you start to bump that in a particular direction to either increase the vertical component of lift or the horizontal component of thrust.” Whereas high-speed tiltrotors like the Bell-Boeing V22 and Leonardo AW609 limit the range of the nacelles in certain speed envelopes, Ava’s relatively low never-exceed speed of 154 knots makes such protections unnecessary. “You can actually tilt the nacelles skyward, and the aircraft will naturally decelerate, even in a dive, to a speed where you can comfortably pull the collective at a 90-degree vector,” he said. That’s not something that Clark has demonstrated in the actual aircraft yet. Working within the constraints of Beta Technologies’ FAA-approved flight test program at Plattsburgh International Airport in New York, he has been expanding Ava’s flight envelope slowly and methodically, thus far achieving speeds of up to 72 knots and a maximum altitude of 100 feet, and flight in winds as high as 25 knots. A large portion of the flight test program has been devoted to mapping the proprotor transition envelope, both in vector angle and airspeed. “Basically the way that’s done is we fly at different airspeeds at a fixed vector angle to the point where we don’t have enough control margin to continue, and we draw an edge on the envelope at that point,” he said.

It seems not a week goes by without the introduction of another electric vertical take-off & landing (eVTOL) startup. Today is no exception, with Beta Technologies, an eVTOL startup from Vermont, joining the crowd.

Kyle Clark wasted no time gathering top-notch engineers from GE Global Research, Scaled Composites, and Tesla, among a few others, as well as the right tools and equipment to build what he sees as the ultimate eVTOL urban air mobility (UAM) vehicles, according to The Drive. The Ava XC is very different from many eVTOL designs we’re accustomed to seeing. It’s part airplane, part tilt-rotor, but nothing like an Osprey.

The Beta Technologies air taxi prototype looks more traditional than the futuristic eVTOL designs of late. His is a heavily modified airplane airframe with 90-degree tilting wings and ailerons supporting 8 electric motors on each end. The aircraft is perched on high landing gears, presumably to accommodate the tilting rotors.

Technically, the Ava XC weighs in a 4,400 lb (1,815 kilo), with a 35-foot (10.7-meter) wing, and has so far accumulated well over 180 test flights approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). And where was it hiding all these years? Under a two-year development shrouded under a secret cloak.

According to Vertical Mag, the Ava XC uses 124 kWh lithium-ion battery packs. Its top speed is 154 knots (177 mph). It will fly 150 miles (240 kilometers) on a full charge, but the production model should reach up to 290 miles (465 kilometers).

As to how safe it is, Clark says the Ava XC was tested at 72 knots and a maximum altitude of 100 feet, with winds as high as 25 knots.

The startup under wrap until this past week received undisclosed funding from United Therapeutics, which is led by SiriusXM satellite radio founder Martine Rothblatt. The Eva XC is not expected to come into production until 2024. And according to Rothblatt:

“We’ve seen seven percent improvements in energy density every year for the past several decades. We need 300 watt-hours per kilogram in order to reach a range of 250 nautical miles, which is what I’m asking for, and it’s a no-brainer to see that we’ll be there in just a few years.”

Clark says using electric motors means having constant torque at any speed and to a certain extent any altitude. The choice of a distributed propulsion system means the flight controls react with instantaneous thrust adjustments at any power level. You won’t hear otherwise here on CleanTechnica. Clark also believes that with an ultra-precise control at any speed and attitude, an eVTOL can safely cut power off, avoid collisions, and even freefall and recover from a stall.

As to how it is piloted, the Ava XC uses a hybrid flight control design with a collective lever in the left hand that modulates the speed of the propellers and thrust. Clark says the control is much lighter than a conventional helicopter collective. The traditional foot pedals control the rudder and clockwise/counter-clockwise differential of the rotors.

There is a right-hand sidestick for the mechanical flight control surfaces and the fly-by-wire controller for distributed propulsion. The right thumb controls a bump switch that tilts the nacelles that modulate the tilt angle and sink rate.

As to how it feels to fly the Ava XC, Clark says: “I liken it to a glassy water landing in a sea plane where you come in … and all you’re doing is looking at the VSI [vertical speed indicator] and you’re setting your sink rate. The same thing’s true when you’re moving this thing forward — if you can feel anything, you know you’re doing something wrong. So you start to bump that in a particular direction to either increase the vertical component of lift or the horizontal component of thrust.”

Beta Technologies, More than an eVTOL Startup

Clark definitely has big dreams for Beta Technologies. He is converting to electricity a vintage Enstrom 28FX helicopter to test the direct-drive electric motors for his Ava XC air taxi prototype. The startup is also working on a solar- and grid-powered recharging pad technology. Clark hopes to install its wireless charging stations in strategic places.

Clark says that Beta Technologies has an approved simulator-based training program designed to train powered lift test pilots. He believes it is the only one in the industry. The simulator is most likely due to having Austin Meyer, the creator of the popular flight simulation software X-Plane, on the team.

21,https://www.wired.com/story/rest-stop-flying-cars-recharge/,"If it weren’t for the racket from a helicopter landing on the roof, the complex of heavily modified and interconnected cargo containers in a corner of Burlington International Airport would be a great place to hang out. The structure has a sleek wood-lined lounge, two cozy bedrooms, and a view from the front porch of Vermont Air National Guard F-35 fighter jets rocketing down the runway. The scene smacks of a villain’s lair.

But this strange outpost isn’t an evil genius’s hideaway or even just a primo plane-spotting perch. Burlington-based Beta Technologies, a three-year-old company that’s developing an electric vertical-lift airplane, created the structure to be a key component in the future of aviation: A charging station for electric aircraft, from pilotless drones to futuristic flying taxis. “It can charge the aircraft, providing accommodations to ‘recharge’ the flight crews, as well, or it can serve as a handoff point for cargo or medical supplies,” says Kyle Clark, Beta’s founder.

The station is designed for the coming wave of electric air taxis—and their demand for fast and reliable charging, something few of the industry’s players have yet to fully explore. Topping off the larger and more powerful batteries used by electric aircraft could cause even greater strains on the grid than electric cars, which already face challenges in getting steady power delivery from charging stations.

Beta developed the stations in tandem with work on its two prototype aircraft, first a small tilt-rotor version called Ava followed by a radically different production version called Alia, set to be revealed within a few weeks. Depending on their configuration, the stations could serve as a charging pad for human-piloted or fully autonomous vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, a landing pad for conventional helicopters, or a way station for cargo deliveries or emergency UAV operations when medical and other supplies are needed during a crisis, such as the current Covid-19 pandemic.

Clark says the stations can be set up in tight urban spaces, where the 20-foot-high landing platform would help ensure safe approaches and departures for all types of rotorcraft, whether full-sized passenger-carrying air taxis or small delivery drones. They’re also suitable for remote, undeveloped areas where they would help extend the range of eVTOL craft. The sleeping quarters and lounges allow crews to rest overnight or simply to kick back while their craft charges. These would be particularly useful if secured and installed at low-volume airports that don’t have hotels or other services nearby.

Technologically, the charging station is an exercise in power management for aircraft charging. “One of the biggest challenges was mitigating the demand that would be created if aircraft were charging directly from the grid,” says Chip Palombini, a Beta engineer, echoing a problem faced frequently at electric car charging stations when the charge rate can be hurt by overall demand.

To solve the problem, the station would be wired to the grid and augmented by large arrays of “second-life” batteries—repurposed from electric cars and other uses—which can be charged either from the grid or with solar panels. Using proprietary power controllers, the stations can deliver juice to the aircraft quickly and efficiently, Clark says. “The system enables ultra-rapid recharge of large electric aircraft without requiring big power lines to serve the load,” he says.",A Rest Stop Where Flying Cars Can Recharge,2020-03-29 13:00:00+00:00,
22,https://www.wired.com/story/beta-ava-flying-car-aviation/,"Plattsburgh, New York, is a tough place to be outside in early January. The small city sits on the western shore of Lake Champlain, 20 miles south of the Canadian border. I’ve just arrived with Kyle Clark and a few of his colleagues, after a quick flight in a 40-year-old Cessna from Burlington, Vermont, on the other side of the lake. It’s snowing, and as we shuffle across the mostly abandoned former Air Force base toward a secluded hangar, I ask Clark if the weather might ice today’s flight plans.

He looks at me and laughs, opening the hangar door. “Not a chance.”

It’s no surprise that Clark—tall, athletic, copiously tattooed, and a former pro hockey player—doesn’t mind the winter weather. But these seem like conditions that would threaten the test flight of a rather complex, entirely new, fully electric aircraft. One whose eight motors and rotors must work in computerized synchrony to keep the ship aloft and true, whether going up, down, or forward.

Clark will have none of such worries. He bounds into the cavernous building that once housed B-52 bombers and introduces me to the Ava XC. The gleaming white contraption, with stilt-like landing gear and eight propellers jutting out in every direction, looks like what Tony Stark would build if he had an Edward Scissorhands phase. It is, in fact, the prototype that Clark’s company, Beta Technologies, has built to not only probe the challenges of electric aviation, but also prove it has the aerospace knowhow itself to compete in the crowded, yet-to-be-realized market for battery-powered vertical takeoff and landing aircraft—what you might call flying cars.

Clark’s version, though, appears to be further along than most. It’s one of the few designs relying heavily on a conventional wing to boost efficiency in horizontal flight, and it's the largest known eVTOL aircraft to fly yet. More importantly, it’s the only one with a confirmed launch customer providing funding. The mostly carbon fiber, 4,000-pound aircraft holds two battery packs totaling 124 kWh. The 34-foot wing sits between outriggers supporting the octet of 143-horsepower permanent-magnet motors and propellers, which pivot from horizontal to 90-degrees straight up. The two layers of counter-rotating props operate independently, so if one layer loses power, the other will keep the Ava in the air—one of many redundancies and safety measures in the aircraft. The funky flyer has a 172 mph top speed and a range of 150 miles.

In the hangar, Clark’s team gets to work preparing the craft for the morning’s test flight. Beta, until now working in secret, has executed 175 of these so far. The plan for the 176th is to position the rotors 70 degrees up from horizontal, to gauge Ava’s stability during the transition from vertical to horizontal flight and back.

The Harvard-educated Clark created Beta in 2017, on the heels of multiple electronics and software startups. (The company name comes from his nickname in college—he was the nerdiest jock of the bunch, apparently.) Beta isn’t overly invested in the much-hyped air taxi market, though. “The goal of this aircraft was to elicit critical thinking about electric aviation,” says Clark, who paid for his pilot’s license with his hockey signing bonus. “The best way to do that was to build something. So we partnered with the company that became our launch customer to create this aircraft, and attempt to fly it across the country.” No better way, he figured, to expose the technical, logistical, and regulatory problems that populate a field now home to more than 130 companies, including Larry Page-funded Kitty Hawk, Airbus, Joby, and Bell.",Beta's Ava Is the Edward Scissorhands of Flying Cars,2019-01-10 14:00:00+00:00,
23,https://www.wired.com/story/beta-ava-flying-car-aerodynamics/,"As he hovered 50 feet above the runway in Plattsburgh, New York, Kyle Clark suddenly had a distinct sinking feeling. A literal one. He had full control just moments before, but his electric, eight-rotor aircraft was dropping fast.

Clark did, however, know this was coming. The founder and chief test pilot of flying car developer Beta Technologies had deliberately put the aircraft into a tricky aerodynamic situation called vortex ring state, or “settling with power.” That’s when the rotors lose lift and the aircraft descends rapidly into air made turbulent by the transition from horizontal flight into a hover. No amount of additional power will allow the aircraft to climb out of it. In fact, adding power can often accelerate the descent. It’s the problem that caused the fatal April 2000 crash of a V-22 Osprey tiltrotor during a test flight, as well as the loss of a Black Hawk helicopter in the 2011 raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden.

It’s also just one of the many often mystifying aerodynamic challenges that neither pilots nor engineers can see but which they can absolutely feel, thanks to the complex forces swirling around clusters of fast-moving blades and all the spindly bits protruding from the fuselage to support motors, generate lift or control, or support landing skids or wheels. It’s a soupy yet fast-moving environment that will require high-level understanding and eventually virtually infallible management if the aviation world’s vision of a new way of flying has any hope of succeeding.

Aircraft makers can minimize the likelihood of vortex ring state with multi-rotor designs that distribute the downwash over a wider area, and pilots learn how to respond to the threat when it happens. As Clark dropped, he sidestepped to the right, moving into cleaner air, where the rotors’ power can be put to use. “I got out just 3 feet above the ground,” he says. “Just because you have a bunch of powerful electric motors and rotors, it doesn’t mean you can simply accelerate out of it.”

That test—one of about 200 so far—counted as a success for the aircraft, called Ava. The new kind of flying machine retained control despite the loss of lift, much like a conventional helicopter. But managing vortex ring state is just one of many challenges facing the development of this entirely new class of electric, multi-rotor, vertical-lift aircraft, dubbed eVTOL but more popularly known as air taxis or flying cars (for their ease of use, not because they also drive).

As companies like Lilium, Joby, and Kitty Hawk explore new configurations—with pivoting rotors, wings, moving control surfaces, and more—they must crack the devilish problem of keeping heavier-than-air machines aloft.

Making an eVTOL aircraft hop off the ground and transition to forward flight is the most pressing challenge here. “We want simplicity in our design and predictable behavior across a wide transition envelope,” Clark says. By that he means making the transition at different speeds and altitudes. “We want it to maintain nice, even responses—what we call control harmony—no matter what config­uration it’s in or what the conditions are. We don’t want it to feel firm and precise in one direction but mushy in another.”",Cracking the Devilish Aerodynamics of Newfangled Flying Cars,2019-03-12 11:00:00+00:00,
24,https://www.wired.com/story/texas-up-evtol-flying-car-conference/,"In the few short years that the modern electric air taxi movement has been gestating—launching in earnest with Uber’s October 2016 proposal for such a service—attention has swirled around the key technological and policy hurdles, from battery propulsion to new aircraft designs to regulation. Little of the conversation, however, has focused on what may be the greatest enabler, or hurdle, of this new way of moving: the public.

You know, the folks who’ll actually be riding in these newfangled contraptions. Do they understand how they work? Will they be comfortable flying through the air in small, and eventually unmanned, vehicles? It’s not enough to promise that these aircraft will be quieter than helicopters or show off CGI animations of a typical flight. If these things are going to fill the skies, the people who today are on the ground must be onboard, metaphorically as much as literally.

That was the essence of the message delivered by former Wyoming governor Matt Mead to an industry gathering at a ranch outside of Dallas last month. “I tell people I’m going to an eVTOL gathering and they think I mean a health conference,” he said at TexasUP, an invitation-only, unannounced summit that followed a similar event held in Arkansas last year. “You folks all live in this world and you understand it so very well. But for a lay person like myself, it's hard to get the passion. It's hard to get the excitement when you first have to explain what the letters mean. Then they say, ‘Oh, are you talking about flying cars?’”

Mead’s point was not just that the industry needs to stamp out or standardize jargon but that doing so will help push citizens, including politicians, to support it. The public is generally good with the idea of electric air taxis, according to a study released early this year by Airbus, though they have concerns around safety and noise. But studies have yet to gauge attitudes toward the broader impact of the technology. “We have to talk about the benefits and the realization of the dream—the amount of hours saved commuting, what it would mean to the GDP, what it would mean for public safety, search and rescue, and more,” Mead said. “Plus, this is an opportunity to democratize our airspace, and to do it safely.”

To reach the best likelihood for success, this argument goes, air taxis should benefit as many, and annoy as few, people as possible. Missteps here can bring down the wrath of publicly elected officials. Consider the fact that New York City is weighing legislation to ban non-emergency helicopter use, in an effort to address noise and safety concerns.",Flying Car Leaders Talk Public Perception at a Secret Summit,2019-12-04 13:00:00+00:00,
25,https://evtol.com/news/beta-technologies-previews-alia-evtol/,"Beta Technologies is gearing up to fly its next eVTOL, ALIA, and it looks great.

Beta founder Kyle Clark revealed the full design of ALIA last week at the exclusive eVTOL leadership summit TexasUP, but with some restrictions on media coverage. So we can’t show you photos of the aircraft, but we can tell you that it’s a significant evolution of the company’s previous prototype, Ava-XC, with ALIA having four fixed propellers mounted above the fuselage and one dedicated pushing propeller, rather than eight pivoting prop and motor assemblies.

Beta projects that Alia’s streamlined design will carry the 6,000-pound (2,720-kilogram) aircraft up to 250 miles (400 kilometers) on a single charge. That’s the kind of range it will need to transport human organs for launch customer United Therapeutics, whose CEO, Martine Rothblatt, is the primary customer for the project.

Not that Ava-XC is anything to sniff at. Although it resembles the Edward Scissorhands version of a Lancair airplane, that prototype has successfully completed more than 200 test flights, most of those with Clark at the controls. “It was an amazing learning experience — it showed us what the most important things in an eVTOL [are],” Clark told the audience at TexasUP.

To design Ava’s successor, the Beta team started with the mission requirements — carrying two people and an appropriately packaged human organ — then applied “the very first principles of engineering,” Clark said. “Make it light, store a lot of energy, convert that energy efficiently, and make a slippery airplane. Then do it in the simplest way possible.”

Beta’s Ava-XC in the hangar. ALIA looks significantly different, with four fixed rotors and one dedicated pushing propeller. Eric Adams Photo

Although their effort started with sketches and computer modeling, it quickly moved into scaled models. “Analytics are great, but it’s hard to hold this team back [from] building real things,” Clark said. “The team here is going through flight testing of scale models over and over and over again, and battle-hardening themselves for the real test. . . . .

“They’re [exploring] the limits of transition corridors, and failures of motors, and lost links, and IMU [inertial measurement unit] failures, and all these things that we don’t want to do in the real plane.”

To validate the edgewise flight loads on ALIA’s VTOL propellers, Beta modified a Ford F550 truck for high-speed ground testing — an approach that is as “simple and easy” as it is effective, Clark said. “We get it to 120 knots, build a 14-foot rig on top of it, put one of these propellers up there, and rip down the runway.”

The team has also built a complete “iron bird” test rig to validate integration of the aircraft’s systems, and experiment with different approaches for pilot control. Clark said that Beta is additionally using the iron bird to test failure modes in a way that will gain credit toward certification from the Federal Aviation Administration.

“This is something that’s important to our program — that we build and deploy and engineer three to four times the amount of test equipment than we do airplane equipment,” he said.

Even with the intense focus on readying ALIA for its upcoming first flight, Beta is not neglecting the ecosystem in which it will operate. As Clark put it, “none of this works without a recharging pad,” so Beta and United Therapeutics have been developing prototypes for a network of recharging pads up and down the East Coast, strategically positioned for organ transport missions.

The recharging pads will perform “energy arbitrage” using battery installations to avoid putting peaky loads on the grid. According to Clark, this should reduce the need for utilities to rely on fossil fuels to meet demand, and can further support the broader penetration of renewables by providing stabilizing real and reactive power back to the grid.

Beta and United Therapeutics are even designing homey rest quarters for the pilots who will be flying the organ transport missions, since “the pilots are really important in this thing,” Clark said. He noted that Beta is simultaneously developing a flight training curriculum that will prepare pilots for this new type of aircraft, which is not quite a helicopter, and not quite an airplane.

“A theme which I think we all need to be aware of as an industry [is] a lack of pilots. . . . We need to inspire a new generation of pilots, and train them in a way they know to learn,” he said.",Beta Technologies shares sneak peek at new eVTOL at TexasUP,,
