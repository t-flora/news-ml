Most Read from Bloomberg

The Feb. 16 incident involved a remotely piloted prototype at the company’s test base in California, according to a regulatory filing. There were no injuries, the company said without detailing the specifics of the accident.

“Experimental flight test programs are intentionally designed to determine the limits of aircraft performance, and accidents are unfortunately a possibility,” Joby said.

The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the accident, which resulted in “substantial damage” to the aircraft, spokesman Peter Knudson said. The NTSB’s authority to investigate all aviation accidents includes most serious drone crashes.

Joby said in the filing that it’s supporting authorities in an investigation.

The shares fell 6% at 11:54 a.m. in New York after an earlier decline of 11%, the biggest intraday slide since Jan. 24.

Joby is one of several startups building electric aircraft that take off vertically like helicopters and then fly like small planes once in the air. Joby is seeking regulatory authorization to fly with an onboard pilot its five-seat air taxi, which has a maximum range of 150 miles (241 kilometers) and a top speed of 200 mph (322 kph).

The accident could complicate Joby’s effort to win approval for the ground-breaking plane, which has already made more than 1,000 successful flights. The startup has said it expects to receive authorization from the Federal Aviation Administration and fly its aircraft commercially by 2024.

Story continues

The flight test involving the accident was not for FAA credit, Morgan Stanley analyst Kristine Liwag wrote in a research note. The company has a second aircraft with which it will likely continue test flights.

Door Still Open

“In our view, the accident with the Joby aircraft does not close the door on FAA certification,” Liwag said. “However, the cause of the accident must be understood.”

Aerospace is a “difficult technical industry,” Liwag said. The analyst highlighted that General Dynamics Corp.’s Gulfstream unit suffered an accident in 2011 during test flights of its G650 jet. That plane went on to be one of private aviation’s most successful and profitable aircraft. The Gulfstream crash killed four employees.

“This execution risk highlights why we have such a wide range of outcomes for Joby considering the nascency of the industry,” said Liwag, who rates the stock the equivalent of a buy.

But Joby is a high-risk stock. So my investment here is tiny (way under 1% of my family investment portfolio).

I'm bullish on this stock because I'm negative about self-driving cars. I don't think the collective intelligence at Alphabet or Tesla can sufficiently plan for all the variables of driving a car in the street. Even if the artificial intelligence-based technology works and reduces car collisions, every accident is a major lawsuit waiting to happen. For example, suppose Tesla manages to reduce the accident rate from 6 million a year (the total number of car accidents in 2018 in the U.S. and assuming all cars are self driven) to 1 million -- which would be incredible -- that's still 1 million lawsuits a year the company will face.

Joby, meanwhile, is changing the transportation landscape in a three-dimensional way. There's almost zero traffic in the sky. The vehicles are way faster and just as quiet. I think Joby could easily go up 10 times in value, just with human pilots. But if robots start flying those things? The sky's the limit.

So I'm investing in Joby now, even though the company has neither earnings nor revenues yet. Why so soon? Because when you're shooting for a 100-bagger, you don't need (or want) a large initial investment. There are so many things that could go wrong, you might lose everything. But the potential upside is so high, it's worth making small investments now before the crowd wakes up and bids up the stock price.

A couple of 100-baggers will make you rich

While a 100-bagger seems impossibly big, it actually happens fairly often. For instance, if you bought shares of Apple in 2004, after the iPod but before the iPhone, you'd have made over 400 times your money by now.

That's nothing compared to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and its insane 3,000-bagger in 35 years.

Here's a short list of some of the stocks that have pulled off the 100-bagger feat:

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)

Walmart (NYSE:WMT)

Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG)

Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)

Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)

Nike (NYSE:NKE)

McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)

If you do the math, you'll see that even a tiny investment in a 100-bagger can make you rich. The 20-year-old college student who bought $500 worth of Microsoft back in 1986 is now a millionaire, just from that one stock buy. So that's why it's worth your time to search for companies chasing massive opportunities, and make small investments while the stock price is still tiny, and the future is uncertain.

How big is the market for air taxis?

A couple of years ago, Morgan Stanley put out a research report that estimates the market for air taxis to reach $1.5 trillion by 2040. It's not hard to see why transportation will go vertical in the future. Joby's aircraft is electric and recently demonstrated how quiet the aircraft, a critical parameter to operate in populated areas. At about 55 decibels during take-off, it's more than a thousand times quieter than a typical helicopter. And that's kind of amazing, because these vehicles are super-fast. How fast? The company's air taxi hit 205 miles an hour in a practice run earlier this year.

The company also demonstrated that the aircraft can fly 150 miles on a single battery charge. The plan is to use them to ferry passengers in and around congested cities. Los Angeles, for instance, is known for its heavy traffic. Electric cars do not fix that problem. Self-driving cars don't fix that problem, either. Nobody likes a traffic snarl, and anything that reduces those bottlenecks will be a blessing. Joby estimates the market for its air taxis in L.A. at $500 million a year. That's just one city!

Tesla in the sky?

How big is the air taxi opportunity? Well, if you don't believe Morgan Stanley's $1.5 trillion number, consider what Elon Musk has to say.

So, over time, we think full self-driving will become the most important source of profitability for Tesla. It's -- actually, if you run the numbers on robotaxis, it's kind of nutty -- it's nutty good from a financial standpoint.

That's thought-provoking. Musk is happy about his fleet of electric cars and his $53 billion in revenues. But he believes self-driving taxis is actually a much bigger opportunity in the future.

Try to imagine investing in Tesla back in 2010, when the company had its initial public offering (IPO). It was a daunting investment. Tesla had no profits and had only sold 1,000 cars in total when the company went public. If the company had suffered a few bad breaks a decade ago, it could have easily gone Chapter 11.

Joby in 2022 is much like Tesla in 2010 -- a highly risky investment opportunity with a huge potential upside. The way you approach a dangerous stock like this is by making a small investment now, and maybe adding to your position as the dangers recede and the market gets more and more excited.

Uber in the sky?

Of course, when you think ""taxis,"" you think Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), the company that disrupted the taxi industry around the world. You might think Uber would be interested in that $1.5 trillion market opportunity, too. And you'd be right. Back in 2016, Uber published a white paper about the future of urban air transportation. Two years later, the ride-sharing giant introduced its prototype vehicle. But Uber was too late to the party, and so in 2020 the company abandoned the race and sold out to Joby (and invested $75 million in the start-up).

Similarly, Toyota decided to invest almost $400 million in Joby last year. That's a major influx of cash. After several financing rounds and its SPAC last year, Joby is now sitting on $1.6 billion dollars.

So here we have a huge market opportunity. Uber sees it, and Toyota sees it. And yet these two massive companies both decided to back Joby instead of going alone. Why?

Joby has a powerful first-mover advantage. The company has been working on its aircraft for over a decade and has been collaborating with NASA since 2012. Joby's near-term goals are to get its aircraft certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), scale up its manufacturing, and launch its air taxi service in 2024. It's in the lead and likely to be first to market in the U.S.

What about self-driving air taxis?

I think Musk's vision of robotaxis in the future is very exciting. But given the congestion in the cities and the pain-points that air taxis solve, I believe this revolution may very well happen in the air first. After all, the first autopilots in aircraft were introduced in 1912! We already have drones in the air. The safety issues with a self-driving aircraft are minuscule compared to the complexities on the ground.

So that's why I've made a tiny investment in Joby Aviation now, even with a significant possibility that I might lose it all. The long-term upside is so massive, I want to have a minor ownership now, in the hopes that Joby can pull off what the company is trying to do."

We're not living in a world where flying cars are the norm, despite how hopeful and optimistic we were of such things a few decades ago.

But that doesn't mean we're far from a future similar to those dreams – indicative of which is the signing of a non-binding memorandum of understanding between Malaysia-based AirAsia Aviation Group Limited (AirAsia) and Ireland-based Avolon, the second biggest aircraft leasing business in the world.

The new partnership will see AirAsia lease a minimum of 100 electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft from Avolon, which the carrier hopes to use as an air ridesharing service in the near future.

The aircraft in question, the VX4 eVTOL by Vertical Aerospace, is a real looker too.

Avolon had pre-ordered 500 examples of the VX4 eVTOL from Vertical Aerospace back in June 2021. AirAsia's endorsement makes it the aircraft's first expansion into Southeast Asia, paving the way for a more sustainable mode of air transport (and transport in general) for the masses.

""The digital era is now. In the VX4, we have identified what we believe will be the eVTOL aircraft of choice and we are thrilled to be the launch airline for the aircraft in Southeast Asia,"" said Tony Fernandes, CEO of Capital A (formerly AirAsia Group).

""We are also delighted to extend our long-standing relationship with Avolon, which has a proven track record of delivering for its customers and is in sync with our goal to become the leading one-stop travel and delivery platform in ASEAN.”

Boasting enough room for five people (one pilot and four passengers), the VX4 can fly at speeds of up to 321 kilometers per hour, with a range of just over 160 kilometers. It's also expected to be near-silent in flight (100 times quieter than a helicopter at cruise and hover), making for a calm and relaxing commute to wherever it is you need to go. Plus, you won't be hurting the environment, thanks to zero operating emissions.

Perhaps the one thing you're worried about is cost, but fret not. According to Vertical, each passenger mile is supposed to be low cost. To make a real-world comparison, the money you'll be paying to ride in a VX4 will cost just a little bit more than a conventional taxi on the ground.

Let's just call it a more premium ridesharing service without the luxurious prices.

According to Fernandes, flights could start by the year 2025, with the company predicting quicker approval from regulators in Malaysia and Singapore, followed by Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines.

Key Takeaways from Market Study

eVTOL aircraft are gaining prominence as urban mobility is taking shape. In China, currently, such aircraft are being used for cargo transportation, majorly aiming to improve aerial logistics. The market in China is expected to expand at close to 30% CAGR through 2031.

The role played by the FAA-Federal Aviation Administration in laying industry standards such as aircraft airworthiness, flight testing, and certification, for eVTOL aircraft, is pivotal. The U.S. is positioned as the top nation in the global market, with the highest market value share. Demand in the U.S. will increase at over 22% CAGR over the next ten years.

Compared to helicopters and other transport media, eVTOLs provide comparatively better features. They emit least noise, are emissions-free, and have a distributed energy propulsion, enabling improved propulsive efficiency. eVTOLs having maximum takeoff weight below 250 kg are expected to create ample opportunities over the forecast period.

Multirotor & rotorcraft eVTOLs will generate credible growth opportunities in future. These aircraft are suitable for commuting in cities where they can travel between shorter distances.

With rising number of autonomous mobility, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) or pilotless aircraft are expected to dominate the global market share, based on operation.

“The number of civil and commercial end uses of eVTOL aircraft will surge as these gradually replace land transportation over the next few years. Rising aircraft developments and surging investments in the aircraft sector are favoring market growth for eVTOL aircraft,” says a Persistence Market Research analyst.

Introduction of Air-taxi Services in Advanced & Emerging Countries

Rise of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) aircraft has changed the paradigm of travel from conventional transport such as cars, buses, and taxis to aerial travel services such as eVTOL. These aircraft are designed to carry up to 10 passengers, commute shorter routes within an urban landscape, provide quick turnarounds for arrivals and departures, and preferably operate autonomously.

This has led to an upsurge in the development of eVTOLs for air-taxi services. Moreover, air-taxis are designed to meet future demand for regional commutes ranging from 30 miles to 300 miles. With growing congestion in urban spaces, the problem of land travel will likely increase. With the use of eVTOLs in the form of air-taxi services, aerial travel will be an affordable transport dimension over shorter places. Use of EVTOLs for air-taxi services is expected to rise by 2023 in select regions, and by 2030 on a global scale.

While the other competitors opted to maintain a lower profile, three of India’s Hindustan Aeronautics Limited-made Tejas showed off their capabilities, courtesy of the No. 18 “Flying Bullets” Squadron based in Sulur. Two of the aircraft participated in aerial displays during the air show, which took place Feb. 15-18 at the Changi Exhibition Centre.

Malaysia is seeking 18 jets to replace its fleet of BAE Systems-made Hawk 108 trainers and Hawk 208 light-attack jets, which were introduced in 1994 and have suffered from increasing attrition.

Korean Aerospace Industries is also competing for Malaysia’s Fighter Lead In Trainer-Light Combat Aircraft program, pitching its FA-50 Golden Eagle multirole jet.

The South Korean company’s booth at the air show included models of the FA-50, the KF-21 Boramae fighter, the Surion helicopter and the Light Armed Helicopter. Its KT-1B turboprop trainers were flown by Indonesia’s Jupiter aerobatics team during an aerial display.

The FA-50 and its predecessor, the T-50 trainer, are regional export success stories, with Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand joining South Korea in operating the type. Outside of the region, Iraq operates the Golden Eagle.

A possible sticking point for the FA-50 could be its Israeli-origin Elta Systems ELM-2032 multimode radar, as Malaysia is adamant in refusing to use Israeli systems over the country’s treatment of Palestinians.

However, KAI’s regional manager, Lee Chang Jae, told Defense News that the FA-50 could be fitted with several other radars based on customer requirements, including an active electronically scanned array set under development by Hanwha for the KF-21 Boramae.

Turkish Aerospace Industries, which also hosted a booth at the air show, is proposing its Hurjet aircraft for Malaysia’s FLIT-LCA program. TAI is offering a strategic partnership with Malaysia to build a supersonic jet trainer for the Royal Malaysian Air Force, in which three would be produced in Turkey and 15 made in Malaysia under license, the company’s CEO, Temel Kotil, said during a Feb. 12 television interview.

“Within the scope of [the] FLIT-LCA program, Turkish Aerospace is making [a] 100% offset commitment through localization and technology transfer. After establishing a strong partnership and collaboration with local Malaysian partners, Turkish Aerospace will present a production process plan including [an] aircraft final assembly line in Malaysia,” the company told Defense News.

If it won the competition, TAI said, the first three aircraft would undergo final assembly in Turkey while the company trains Malaysian engineers and technicians.

TAI would also transfer to local partners high-tech aerospace components such as wings, horizontal and vertical stabilizers, and rudders, as well as metallic and composite detail-parts manufacturing, component-level structural assembly, and system integration activities. The firm would also carry out weapon systems integration in Malaysia.

“It would be very useful for the program if the local partner [acquiring] these activities should have prior capabilities and capacity in similar areas,” TAI said.

The other FLIT-LCA contenders who also had booths at the air show were Italian firm Leonardo and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, who are offering the M-346 Master and Hongdu L-15 Falcon, respectively.

Media reports have also said Russia’s Rosoboronexport is offering the MiG-35 for the Malaysian tender."

Wind tunnels that simulate air movement around an in-flight aircraft are widely used in the aerospace industry. They allow aeronautical engineers to control the conditions affecting the forces and motion of the plane. The engineer can determine and analyze the magnitude of forces on a real full-size aircraft by recreating it on a scaled-down aircraft model. Further, the wind tunnel-based model can also be applied for testing and diagnostics to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the aerodynamics of the aircraft body by determining the air movement around or through the aircraft. Wind tunnels were primarily used to observe and determine the fundamental working of new aircraft designs, but the dominance of tube and wing design in the market has led to extensive use in the verification and certification processes. The dynamic nature of aeronautic research and more efficient integration with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software contributes to the widespread use of wind tunnels.

The specifications of aircraft model testing have become highly stringent, leading to an increase in the use of wind tunnels made of carbon-epoxy and other composite materials. These tunnels are fabricated using masters prepared through numerically controlled machining. These lightweight models exhibit dimensional accuracy, long-term stability, and hollowness; thus, a comprehensive range of instrumentation can be carried through them. These advancements in wind tunnels ensure that the effects of aerodynamic interference between the models and their support and instrumentation systems are significantly reduced during wind tunnel testing. The tunnels are designed for specific purposes and are often integrated with sensors and components to generate precise test results. For example, PCB offers complete dynamic pressure sensors, microphones, and force sensors for wind tunnels. These components for wind tunnels are categorized based on the speed of the wind.

During 2020–2021, the aerospace industry witnessed a dramatic fall in aircraft production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Major aircraft manufacturers experienced a gradual rise in demand with the resumption of air travel after the successful implementation and scale-up of vaccination programs. These developments triggered the production performances of prominent aircraft manufacturers, such as Boeing and Airbus. In 2021, Boeing delivered over 340 jetliners to airlines and other buyers, up from 157 in 2020. Further, Airbus delivered 611 passenger jets in 2021, with an 8% rise in 2020. Therefore, the gradually growing aerospace industry and the widespread use of wind tunnels in aircraft production bolsters market growth.

Wind Tunnel Market: Solution Overview

Based on solution, the wind tunnel market is segmented into products and services. In 2021, the services segment led the wind tunnel market and accounted for a larger market share. The reduced operation & maintenance (O&M) costs of wind tunnels, and the easy availability of technical installation and maintenance, are the primary factors driving the growth of the segment.

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Wind Tunnel Market:

The COVID-19 outbreak had a drastically adverse impact on the world economy during its peak in 2020, and the crisis had a significantly negative impact on the automotive and aerospace industries. Before the COVID–19, the wind tunnel market was experiencing substantial growth due to the rising production of aircraft and automobiles; however, the virus outbreak led to a notable slowdown in the production activities of these industries deploying the wind tunnel market solutions. The various containment measures, such as lockdowns, business shutdown, and trade restrictions, negatively impacted the production and supply chain of the wind tunnel market until the second half of 2020 and during the second large outbreak in 2021.

Wind tunnels that simulate air movement around an in-flight aircraft are widely used in the aerospace industry. They allow aeronautical engineers to control the conditions affecting the forces and motion of the plane. The engineer can determine and analyze the magnitude of forces on a real full-size aircraft by recreating it on a scaled-down aircraft model. Further, the wind tunnel-based model can also be applied for testing and diagnostics to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the aerodynamics of the aircraft body by determining the air movement around or through the aircraft. Wind tunnels were primarily used to observe and determine the fundamental working of new aircraft designs, but the dominance of tube and wing design in the market has led to extensive use in the verification and certification processes. The dynamic nature of aeronautic research and more efficient integration with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software contributes to the widespread use of wind tunnels.

The specifications of aircraft model testing have become highly stringent, leading to an increase in the use of wind tunnels made of carbon-epoxy and other composite materials. These tunnels are fabricated using masters prepared through numerically controlled machining. These lightweight models exhibit dimensional accuracy, long-term stability, and hollowness; thus, a comprehensive range of instrumentation can be carried through them. These advancements in wind tunnels ensure that the effects of aerodynamic interference between the models and their support and instrumentation systems are significantly reduced during wind tunnel testing. The tunnels are designed for specific purposes and are often integrated with sensors and components to generate precise test results. For example, PCB offers complete dynamic pressure sensors, microphones, and force sensors for wind tunnels. These components for wind tunnels are categorized based on the speed of the wind.

During 2020–2021, the aerospace industry witnessed a dramatic fall in aircraft production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Major aircraft manufacturers experienced a gradual rise in demand with the resumption of air travel after the successful implementation and scale-up of vaccination programs. These developments triggered the production performances of prominent aircraft manufacturers, such as Boeing and Airbus. In 2021, Boeing delivered over 340 jetliners to airlines and other buyers, up from 157 in 2020. Further, Airbus delivered 611 passenger jets in 2021, with an 8% rise in 2020. Therefore, the gradually growing aerospace industry and the widespread use of wind tunnels in aircraft production bolsters market growth.

Zilin Jiang joined Arizona State University in January 2021 with a joint position as assistant professor in the School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences and the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence. Jiang and a team of researchers at MIT recently solved this long-standing problem with the results published in the Annals of Mathematics, “Equiangular lines with a fixed angle.” Illustration by Zilin Jiang Download Full Image

What are equiangular lines?

Jiang explains: “Try to imagine all kinds of ways of arranging lines in space, but the particular arrangements we are interested in are the arrangement of lines so that they are pairwise separated by the same angle. Here are two examples. In a two-dimensional plane, you can think about a regular hexagon and three diagonal lines that pairwise are separated by 60 degrees. Then you can ask the same question in three dimensions — you want to place as many lines as possible in three-dimensional space so that the lines are pairwise separated by the same angle. It turns out the best way to do that is with a regular icosahedron, which has 12 vertices, so that you can pair them together to form six diagonal lines which are separated by the same angle.”

“As mathematicians, we ask the question for two dimensions, then three dimensions, and then we start asking about high dimensions. And that’s the problem we wanted to solve,” said Jiang.

Before coming to ASU, Jiang was a postdoctoral researcher at MIT, working with Assistant Professor Yufei Zhao. Along with Zhao’s PhD student and two undergraduate students, the group of five teamed up to work on the problem as a summer research project.

The problem dates back to the 1970s and has a connection to an area of math called elliptic geometry. There were some early developments on the problem of equiangular lines, but then it became dormant for a while. When Jiang was a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon, his PhD adviser, Boris Bukh, took a look at the problem again.

“He likes to look into the literature and see if the modern techniques can shed new light on the problem, and he made some progress in that direction,” said Jiang.

Jiang read Bukh’s paper, noting there are still cases that are wide open in higher dimensions. He tried to make some further progress on it, but as a graduate student, he didn’t manage to do anything — but the problem was sitting in the back of his mind.

“Some people say there are little people in your brain that just work on the problem secretly and quietly, without you noticing it,” said Jiang, as he gestures with his fingers moving back and forth like little legs dangling behind his head. “Fast-forward maybe one year later, I was a postdoc at Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, and I saw this new work by Benjamin Sudakov, Peter Keevash, Igor Balla and Felix Dräxler, and they pushed the progress much further, but still, it's not fully resolved. There are still open cases. I was just talking to my colleague at Technion and trying to find ways to pin down what essentially was left out in all the previous work.”

The missing ingredient was something in the field of spectral graph theory.

Graph theory is about learning properties of networks. Imagine a social network where people can be friends, so they are connected. The graph is just an abstract way to represent a network where people will become vertices or nodes. If two people are connected, they form an edge between those nodes, and this is what is called a graph.

Spectral graph theory is an interesting way to look at graphs, namely when one can represent a graph or translate a graph into a matrix and look at its eigenvalues. Spectral graph theory has turned out to be extremely useful in computer science, with applications such as Google’s superior PageRank algorithm.

Equiangular lines are examples of spherical codes, which are used to translate a message written in one form into a point on a high-dimensional sphere. This has important implications for information theory and communications.

“When we look at the equiangular lines problem, for each line, you can associate it with a vector. The vector is pointing in the direction of the line. If you start with a set of arrangements of lines separated by the same angles, and for each line you pick such a vector, these vectors will enjoy fantastic properties. You could imagine that these lines are originally arranged very symmetrically, and now the vectors you get out of those lines will also be quite symmetric – so that's one part of the story.

“From the information theoretical perspective, when you try to transmit information, you are basically sending vectors from one party to another. Let’s say I want to send an email to you, but at the end of the day, that’s just a sequence of zeros or ones. You can also just treat it as a vector, where the entries are just zeros and ones. And because of the transmission of information, noise could occur and the message could be corrupted. Information theorists try to come up with a selection of those vectors that are resilient to noise – and that translates to special properties of the selected vectors. One of the properties they would like to have is all the vectors be pairwise separated by the same angle. That’s the connection between the problem with the equiangular lines and coding theory,” said Jiang."

Leaders of aviation and petroleum groups have committed to an initiative laying out a clear plan to transition piston-engine aircraft to lead-free aviation fuels by the end of 2030.

Announced at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., today, the Eliminate Aviation Gasoline Lead Emissions (EAGLE) initiative calls for an industry and government partnership to expand and accelerate the actions and policies necessary for a viable high-octane unleaded replacement for the current 100 octane low-lead aviation gasoline (100LL), without compromising the existing U.S. transportation infrastructure system, aviation safety, and the economic and broader public benefits of general aviation.

The FAA hosted an industry stakeholder roundtable meeting in November 2021 to discuss a strategic plan toward an unleaded avgas future, culminating in the establishment of the EAGLE initiative, which is structured around four key pillars – Regulatory and Policy, Unleaded Fuel Testing and Qualification, Research and Development, and Business Infrastructure and Implementation. These activities, which will require full government support, provide the foundation toward safe unleaded aviation fuels for piston-engine aircraft. Industry stakeholders and the FAA will begin working on the EAGLE initiative right away with a partnership symposium, to define a detailed workplan, planned for March.

FAA Administrator Steve Dickson pledged the FAA’s support of the initiative’s collaborative partnership.

“This is a safe and practical path to a lead-free aviation system,” FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said. “We look forward to starting this new partnership with aviation stakeholders to achieve this important goal.”

Groups committed to the EAGLE initiative include the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA), American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE), American Petroleum Institute (API), Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA), General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), Helicopter Association International (HAI), National Air Transportation Association (NATA), and National Business Aviation Association (NBAA).

“Securing a lead-free future for aviation fuel is a formidable challenge, but the aviation community has faced and met previous challenges with ingenuity and imagination,” said Jack J. Pelton, CEO and Chairman of the Board of the Experimental Aircraft Association. “Our goal is to solve the complex issues surrounding lead-free aviation fuels with innovations that ensure safety, as well as reliability, marketplace availability, and continue to provide the countless benefits of general and recreational aviation to our nation and the world.”

“The future of light general aviation depends on moving away from leaded fuels. To accomplish this imperative, it is important to note that our industry, as well as the industry providing our avgas, are united in partnering with the FAA to advance a sustainable future. The EAGLE public-private partnership will ensure coordination of a safe and reliable transition to an unleaded future state for piston-engine aircraft. GAMA’s manufacturing and maintenance companies look forward to working with the FAA, industry colleagues and other stakeholders to carry out this challenging and ambitious initiative. EAGLE will be the enabler for meeting our environment goals while keeping aviation safety, as well as the broader economic and public benefits provided by general aviation, at the forefront,” said Pete Bunce, GAMA President and CEO.

“While the industry has a shared vision of a lead-free aviation future, the transition must be done in a smart and safe way, and in a manner that works for the entire general aviation fleet,” said Mark Baker, President and CEO of AOPA. “Joining together in a broad coalition to reinforce our commitment, and outlining the plan to get there, is a very positive step forward. We look forward to making good progress under the EAGLE banner.”

“Environmental stewardship is a high priority for airport executives, and AAAE is pleased to join with FAA and our partners in the general aviation industry to chart a path forward to a lead-free future for aviation fuel,” AAAE President & CEO Todd Hauptli. “The EAGLE initiative sets a meaningful goal that will benefit the environment, public health, and the future of general aviation, which plays such an important role in communities across the country and to the national economy. We look forward to working with the government and our industry partners to make the promises of EAGLE a reality.”

“We welcome the opportunity to partner with the FAA and general aviation industry to develop an achievable pathway that safely transitions piston-engine aircraft to unleaded aviation fuels. The EAGLE public-private partnership brings together the critical cross-section of industry and government expertise that will be necessary to succeed in this complex undertaking. We look forward being a part of this collaborative effort to deliver a solution that ensures general aviators’ continued access to the safe and reliable fuels while strengthening environmental progress .” – API VP of Downstream Policy Ron Chittim.

“The EAGLE initiative brings together stakeholders dedicated to advancing a sustainable future for general aviation. It is imperative that we safely transition piston-engine aircraft to lead-free aviation fuel by the end of 2030. This initiative is the right thing to do for the environment and the economic health of our industry. Helicopter Association International (HAI) is committed to this partnership and applauds the broad public-private partnership that has come together enabling industry and government to accelerate a solution. The vertical flight industry is eager to work with all stakeholders to move the EAGLE initiative forward,” said James Viola, HAI President and CEO.

National Air Transportation Association President and CEO Timothy Obitts stated, ""NATA and its members are dedicated to finding a single drop-in unleaded fuel to replace 100LL that is compatible with existing infrastructure. We thank the FAA for its guidance and support, and look forward to working with our industry partners toward a safe and viable solution. The EAGLE initiative is another great example of how we are uniting for the safety, success, and future of the industry.”

“We are proud to be a part of this pioneering initiative to chart a course for a future free of leaded fuels,” said NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen. “The EAGLE initiative is a very important step in ensuring the sustainability, safety and security of aviation in the years to come.”

The Eliminate Aviation Gasoline Lead Emissions (EAGLE) initiative calls for an industry/government partnership to expand and accelerate the actions and policies necessary for a viable high-octane unleaded replacement for the current 100 octane low-lead aviation gasoline (100LL), without compromising the existing U.S. transportation infrastructure system, aviation safety, and the economic and broader public benefits of general aviation.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 23, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Leaders of aviation and petroleum groups have committed to an initiative laying out a clear plan to transition piston-engine aircraft to lead-free aviation fuels by the end of 2030.

Announced at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., today, the Eliminate Aviation Gasoline Lead Emissions (EAGLE) initiative calls for an industry and government partnership to expand and accelerate the actions and policies necessary for a viable high-octane unleaded replacement for the current 100 octane low-lead aviation gasoline (100LL), without compromising the existing U.S. transportation infrastructure system, aviation safety, and the economic and broader public benefits of general aviation.

The FAA hosted an industry stakeholder roundtable meeting in November 2021 to discuss a strategic plan toward an unleaded avgas future, culminating in the establishment of the EAGLE initiative, which is structured around four key pillars – Regulatory and Policy, Unleaded Fuel Testing and Qualification, Research and Development, and Business Infrastructure and Implementation. These activities, which will require full government support, provide the foundation toward safe unleaded aviation fuels for piston-engine aircraft. Industry stakeholders and the FAA will begin working on the EAGLE initiative right away with a partnership symposium, to define a detailed workplan, planned for March.

Story continues

FAA Administrator Steve Dickson pledged the FAA's support of the initiative's collaborative partnership.

""This is a safe and practical path to a lead-free aviation system,"" FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said. ""We look forward to starting this new partnership with aviation stakeholders to achieve this important goal.""

Groups committed to the EAGLE initiative include the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA), American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE), American Petroleum Institute (API), Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA), General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), Helicopter Association International (HAI), National Air Transportation Association (NATA), and National Business Aviation Association (NBAA).

""Securing a lead-free future for aviation fuel is a formidable challenge, but the aviation community has faced and met previous challenges with ingenuity and imagination,"" said Jack J. Pelton, CEO and Chairman of the Board of the Experimental Aircraft Association. ""Our goal is to solve the complex issues surrounding lead-free aviation fuels with innovations that ensure safety, as well as reliability, marketplace availability, and continue to provide the countless benefits of general and recreational aviation to our nation and the world.""

""The future of light general aviation depends on moving away from leaded fuels. To accomplish this imperative, it is important to note that our industry, as well as the industry providing our avgas, are united in partnering with the FAA to advance a sustainable future. The EAGLE public-private partnership will ensure coordination of a safe and reliable transition to an unleaded future state for piston-engine aircraft. GAMA's manufacturing and maintenance companies look forward to working with the FAA, industry colleagues and other stakeholders to carry out this challenging and ambitious initiative. EAGLE will be the enabler for meeting our environment goals while keeping aviation safety, as well as the broader economic and public benefits provided by general aviation, at the forefront,"" said Pete Bunce, GAMA President and CEO.

""While the industry has a shared vision of a lead-free aviation future, the transition must be done in a smart and safe way, and in a manner that works for the entire general aviation fleet,"" said Mark Baker, President and CEO of AOPA. ""Joining together in a broad coalition to reinforce our commitment, and outlining the plan to get there, is a very positive step forward. We look forward to making good progress under the EAGLE banner.""

""Environmental stewardship is a high priority for airport executives, and AAAE is pleased to join with FAA and our partners in the general aviation industry to chart a path forward to a lead-free future for aviation fuel,"" AAAE President & CEO Todd Hauptli. ""The EAGLE initiative sets a meaningful goal that will benefit the environment, public health, and the future of general aviation, which plays such an important role in communities across the country and to the national economy. We look forward to working with the government and our industry partners to make the promises of EAGLE a reality.""

""We welcome the opportunity to partner with the FAA and general aviation industry to develop an achievable pathway that safely transitions piston-engine aircraft to unleaded aviation fuels. The EAGLE public-private partnership brings together the critical cross-section of industry and government expertise that will be necessary to succeed in this complex undertaking. We look forward being a part of this collaborative effort to deliver a solution that ensures general aviators' continued access to the safe and reliable fuels while strengthening environmental progress ."" – API VP of Downstream Policy Ron Chittim.

""The EAGLE initiative brings together stakeholders dedicated to advancing a sustainable future for general aviation. It is imperative that we safely transition piston-engine aircraft to lead-free aviation fuel by the end of 2030. This initiative is the right thing to do for the environment and the economic health of our industry. Helicopter Association International (HAI) is committed to this partnership and applauds the broad public-private partnership that has come together enabling industry and government to accelerate a solution. The vertical flight industry is eager to work with all stakeholders to move the EAGLE initiative forward,"" said James Viola, HAI President and CEO.

National Air Transportation Association President and CEO Timothy Obitts stated, ""NATA and its members are dedicated to finding a single drop-in unleaded fuel to replace 100LL that is compatible with existing infrastructure. We thank the FAA for its guidance and support, and look forward to working with our industry partners toward a safe and viable solution. The EAGLE initiative is another great example of how we are uniting for the safety, success, and future of the industry.""

""We are proud to be a part of this pioneering initiative to chart a course for a future free of leaded fuels,"" said NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen. ""The EAGLE initiative is a very important step in ensuring the sustainability, safety and security of aviation in the years to come.""

Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q4 2021 SP Plus Corporation Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Kris Roy. Please go ahead.

Kris Roy

Thank you, Chino, and good afternoon, everyone. As Chino just said, I'm Kris Roy, Chief Financial Officer of SP Plus. Welcome to our conference call following the release of our fourth quarter 2021 earnings.

During the call today, management will make remarks that may be considered forward-looking statements, including statements as to the impact of COVID-19, outlook and expectations for 2022, and statements regarding the Company's strategies, plans, intentions, future operations, and expected financial performance. Actual results, performance, and achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied, due to a variety of risks, uncertainties, or other factors, including those described in the Company's earnings release issued earlier this afternoon, which is incorporated by reference for purposes of this call and available on the SP Plus website; and the risk factors in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.

In addition, management will discuss non-GAAP financial information during the call. Management believes the presentation of non-GAAP results provides investors with useful supplemental information concerning the Company's ongoing operations and is an appropriate way to evaluate the Company's performance. They are provided for informational purposes only. A full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures are presented in the tables accompanying the earnings release.

In addition, GAAP gross profit has been updated to include depreciation and amortization. To the extent other non-GAAP financial measures are discussed on the call, reconciliations to comparable GAAP measure will be posted under the Regulation G tab in the Investor Relations section of SP Plus' website.

Please note this call is being broadcast live over the Internet and is being recorded. A replay will be available on the SP Plus website shortly after the end of the call and will be available for 30 days from today.

I will now turn the call over to Marc Baumann, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

Marc Baumann

Thank you, Kris, and good afternoon, everybody. Good to be with you today.

We're pleased to report on the positive momentum we've experienced throughout 2021, which has accelerated our company's recovery from the pandemic and presents a runway for future growth. In other words, SP Plus has reached an inflection point, with expectations for our 2022 operating performance to approach or exceed pre-pandemic 2019, which, by the way, was a record year for SP Plus on virtually all financial measures.

We've seen a steady and consistent improvement in the levels of parking activity and demand for our services throughout the year, particularly in those markets that were most severely impacted by the pandemic, such as those tied to leisure, travel, and entertainment, resulting in our improved financial performance. We're very pleased to report fourth quarter results, which were in line with our expectations and represented a strong finish to a year of progressive improvement for SP Plus.

Fourth quarter 2021 adjusted gross profit was up 42% year-on-year but remained 9% below fourth quarter 2019 levels. This excellent progress indicates there's still some additional runway for recovery, particularly in certain market verticals.

EBITDA was just 2% below pre-pandemic fourth quarter 2019 levels, as we were able to achieve substantial operating leverage and improving business conditions, given our streamlined cost structure, together with our success in capturing new business.

Our Commercial segment was a solid performer, both in the fourth quarter and full year, as we were able to successfully capitalize on changing consumer trends and our ability to quickly respond to the dynamic needs of our clients as things start to return back to normal.

In our Aviation segment, 2021 was a year of significant growth, but there is a somewhat longer road back to full recovery for this segment, given the pandemic's ongoing impact on our travel clients. That said, 2021 was a year of strong new business and renewal activity, and by all accounts, the outlook for the travel industry is bullish.

We're responding to the needs of our particularly hard-hit airport, airline, and cruise line clients, and prospective clients by developing novel solutions, such as curbside concierge and consumer-paid remote airline check-in services that are gaining traction due to the positive impact on the travel experience and the ability to reduce congestion while reducing our clients' costs. In addition, we're continuing to see a lot of excitement about our suite of innovative Sphere technology offerings, and we continue to lead the digital transformation of our industry.

These competitive advantages continue to differentiate SP Plus and reinforce our market leadership. Our ability to exit 2021 with such strong results is due to the strategic priorities that we put in place in early 2020, upon the onset of the pandemic. In essence, as we managed through the worst of the times, we had three key objectives in mind: first, to streamline our cost structure while staying nimble and retaining the ability to scale up our activity levels to meet client demand. Second, to continue to invest in our technology offerings in an effort to meet the dynamic and diverse needs of our current and prospective clients. And third, to maintain our industry-leading position and our solid cash flow.

Let me address our streamlined cost structure. We've taken a close look at costs throughout the organization and transformed our operations to become a leaner, more nimble organization. While some costs will naturally increase over time as the business grows, we're also reinvesting some of the savings back into initiatives and resources to drive faster growth.

Technology remains a huge competitive advantage for SP Plus, which is why we accelerated our investments in this area, even during the most challenging of times. The beauty of our technology solutions is that they improve the consumer experience while increasing our clients' profitability, through increasing top line revenues and/or lowering operating costs.

Additionally, our offerings support the touchless way of doing business, which we believe will be the norm for the future. Our Sphere brand of technology products and service offerings also serve to increase our value to our clients, which is supported by our high retention rates and allows us to expand our addressable market. We'll continue to invest further in these products and offerings, as we view Sphere as a key differentiator for SP Plus.

Our streamlined cost structure and technology offerings have created a path toward improved positioning and market share gains. We continue to pursue and win new business while maintaining existing business. In our Commercial segment, we were able to maintain a high location retention rate of 91%, and our Commercial segment location count was over 3,000 at the end of 2021. We also added several new aviation clients to our portfolio and added services at legacy operations. Importantly, we ended 2021 with a more stable base of business, in light of the increased percentage of our base that is now managed locations. Thus, we believe that SP Plus is better positioned as we emerge from the pandemic than we were when we entered.

Looking ahead, we expect 2022 to be another year of significant growth for SP Plus, in which gross profit and adjusted EBITDA will approach or exceed 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Adjusted gross profit is expected to range from $200 million to $220 million, which at the midpoint represents year-on-year growth of 13% over 2021 adjusted gross profit. We expect growth to come from both our Commercial and Aviation segments.

In the Commercial segment, we're anticipating a rebound in verticals like hospitality, events, and venues, municipal meters, and office buildings. In Aviation, we're expecting a pickup in our activity levels across service areas, particularly valet, shuttle busing, and ground transportation management.

Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range from $110 million to $120 million, which at the midpoint represents 21% year-over-year growth. Our outlook for free cash flow is between $70 million to $80 million, which contemplates the receipt of a $20 million income tax refund that we had expected but didn't receive in 2021.

To sum up, we believe SP Plus is exceptionally well positioned for continued profitable growth. We continue to focus on delivering superior client service, which has kept our retention levels high and enabled us to sell in additional services to our existing clients.

Our Sphere capabilities have reinforced our market leadership and have given us opportunities to deploy our proprietary technology in new areas that expand our addressable market and our strengthened financial position and solid cash flow generation provides the financial flexibility to continue to invest in organic growth while pursuing capital allocation strategies that can create additional value for shareholders.

Now I'm going to turn the call back over to Kris for his financial review. Kris?

Kris Roy

Thank you, Marc. I'm pleased to share more color on our financial performance in the fourth quarter, which marked a strong finish to 2021. This is reflected in the adjusted results that I'll be discussing today. As always, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon for our GAAP results and a full reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures.

We reported a 42% year-over-year increase in adjusted gross profit to $49.3 million in the 2021 fourth quarter, compared to $34.6 million a year ago. This performance reflects a substantial recovery in business activity as demand for our services track the reopening of the broader economy, compared to the year ago period when we were still significantly impacted by the pandemic.

While adjusted G&A expenses were up 6% year-over-year to $23.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 as compared to $22.5 million in the year-ago quarter, this is primarily related to added costs and investments to support the increased business level of activity. Despite this increase, 2021 fourth quarter adjusted G&A still remained 15% below the fourth quarter of 2019.

The last pre-pandemic quarter, which is an indication of how we have streamlined our company to do things faster, better, smarter. While some of these costs will progressively return, we think that a significant portion of these savings will stay in place as a result of streamlining administrative functions, driving process efficiencies, and tightening control -- tightly controlling discretionary spending.

Now let me briefly sum up our full-year 2021 performance. We reported a 44% increase in adjusted gross profit to $185.5 million, reflecting the substantial recovery, with COVID-19 restrictions easing and higher vaccination rates encouraging increased consumer activity, including travel and leisure in 2021.

As our business conditions were nearing the pre-pandemic levels, our expenses in 2021 started to normalize as well. Adjusted G&A expenses increased 13% year-over-year, from $77.3 million in 2020 to $87 million in 2021. As a reminder, at the onset of the pandemic in 2020, we reduced compensation and tightened up on discretionary spending.

But by the end of 2020, we reinstated base salaries for those employees affected by the pay reductions enacted earlier in the year. In 2021, we restored certain performance-based compensation programs, which explains the majority of our year-over-year increase. All things considered, we managed effectively throughout 2021, and with the permanent cost cuts I mentioned earlier, adjusted G&A costs in 2021 still remain 19% below the comparable period of 2019.

Now switching gears a bit, full-year 2021 free cash flow was $41.8 million, a 46% increase over 2020. We realized a significant year-over-year increase, despite the fact that we paid $15.9 million in 2021 for payroll taxes that were deferred from 2020. Considering that a $20 million income tax refund we expected in 2021 was pushed to 2022, our results were in line with our expectations. So the delay is just a matter of timing, and the refund has been contemplated in our 2022 free cash flow guidance that Marc gave. Even excluding the income tax refund, our 2022 free cash flow is expected to grow more than 30% at the midpoint over 2021.

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chino to begin the Q&A session. Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Daniel Moore from CJS Securities.

Daniel Moore

Very solid results and even more solid outlook, obviously. What impact, if any, did Omicron have on your business in Q4 and as we look into Q1? And I'm thinking both from a revenue perspective and also from a cost perspective. Historically, it was a labor-intensive business, and those that -- many others have had significant labor challenges, but you seemed to overcome them very well. So maybe just talk about that a little bit, if you could.

Marc Baumann

I mean, I'll just make one overall comment. I think the pleasant surprise that we had, given all of the labor issues, is that at the peak of Omicron, we only had about 2% of our workforce out on sick leave, and that was remarkably low. I know some people in allied industries and other industries where they were facing 20%, 30% of people out on sick leave. So I don't really -- I think our organization really did not see any significant effect in terms of our ability to staff locations and operate. Clearly, some people did make decisions to stay home -- and I'm talking about people that would been traveling and using our services -- and so there was a fall back. We saw this in air travel after the holidays, which would occur anyway. But I think everybody sort of recognizes, in looking at the media, that that wave is passed and people are getting back out there.

Daniel Moore

Indeed, very helpful. And the Aviation segment, if I have my math right, gross profit was nearly $75 million pre-pandemic, now fell to $40 million in fiscal '20. What did that look like in fiscal '21? Just trying to get a sense for how much we still have to make up as travel reemerges in some of those business lines start to reemerge over time?

Kris Roy

Yes. I would say, Dan, if you look at Aviation as a segment, if you look at how we shook out for '21 -- and we'll have this in the 10-K as we file this over the next coming days, but that shook out right around the mid-40s in terms of kind of gross profit. And so, if you look at that business, certainly, Marc mentioned this, and we've kind of mentioned this from -- in previous calls. The road for recovery in Aviation is just going to be a little bit longer. Certainly, you're seeing travel and leisure come back.

I think some of our clients have been a little bit slower to implement some of the services that we had on a pre-pandemic basis, so they've got a couple of different things that they need to think through. Some of it is the cost. And certainly, you're seeing increased activity just with people movement, so I think they're -- as they evaluate our services, they're trying to find the right opportunity to bring back those services to meet both the needs of the passengers and travelers, as well as the needs from a financial perspective.

Daniel Moore

So it doesn't sound like the guidance did anticipated -- it anticipates some recovery, but clearly not giving the lion's share of it back in fiscal '22.

Marc Baumann

No. And I think one thing to remind ourselves of, when we went into the pandemic, we -- the Aviation segment, in particular, has a lot of large, complex contracts, and some of those contracts were going to perform very, very badly in 2020. And so, we set out on a path to restructure a number of those deals. We exited some deals. We changed the economic arrangements of some of those deals. We've talked about this on prior calls.

And that's why we often, when referring to the recovery path, we talk about getting back to pre-COVID EBITDA faster than we can get back to pre-COVID gross profit. That's true for Aviation more so, in many ways, than the Commercial division. So we will eventually surpass 2019 gross profit in Aviation, but in order to get there, there's a combination of the recovery, which Kris is talking about -- the clients bringing us back to provide all the services.

And we're certainly expecting a full crew season in 2022 and other values continue to reopen at some of our big airports, and they're bringing on more shuttle bus routes that have been mothballed. But ultimately, for us to surpass 2022 Aviation gross profit -- 2019 aviation gross profit, excuse me -- we're going to have to continue our great track record of winning new opportunities. And so, I think that it's really going to be a combination of those things that will eventually get us back above 2019 gross profit for Aviation.

Daniel Moore

Perfect. And maybe last one for me, I'll jump back. But any examples or just maybe a little bit of updated color on how Sphere is enhancing your ability to win new business, but also to expand service offerings to offer additional service offerings to existing clients.

Marc Baumann

Yes, I mean, it's become the focal point to decision-making by the client base. And what we've learned is a couple of things. Some of this, as we've talked about before, and the one is that we can capture transaction fees off of processing transactions through the Sphere platform. And I was just looking through my notes before the call, and we had about 250,000 transactions in Q3. So, if you -- I'm annualizing that now; it will be about $1 million, right? And we had a couple of days in December that were 7,000 or 8,000 transactions, so annualize those, and you're up at around $3 million.

So we are continuing to push transactions through that platform. We see there's more opportunity for that. And it becomes a differentiator in the decision-making that clients are using. So, the key for us is that we have to continue to roll out and enhance the capabilities of that platform, and so we have a number of new functions and capabilities coming out over the next couple of months that we think will make it even a more attractive platform for our client base.

Daniel Moore

All right, thanks for the color. Again, I'll jump back with any follow-ups.

Operator

Next question comes from the line of Tim Mulrooney from William Blair.

Tim Mulrooney

Congrats on a nice quarter. So, a couple of questions. Number one, Kris, did you say that the Aviation segment did gross profit in the mid-40s in 2021?

Kris Roy

Yes. I don't have that number right in front of me, Tim, but I'd say it's kind of like in that just below the midpoint of $40 million in terms of the Aviation segment.

Daniel Moore

Was there a big step up in the fourth quarter? Because I have you only doing about $10 million, have you doing about $27 million through the first three quarters of 2021. So, to end at $44 million or something means there was a big step-up in gross profit in the fourth quarter. Am I thinking about that right?

Kris Roy

Yes. Certainly, we've had some increased activity in our Aviation group as you continue to see passenger travels continue, travel and leisure is resuming. Certainly, it's a more heavily trafficked time frame of the year, with the holidays and the like. So, from a seasonality perspective, our Aviation business tends to perform pretty well in the fourth quarter.

Daniel Moore

Okay. That's helpful. Another, I guess, kind of bookkeeping. When I look at 2019 gross profit, it was about $228 million. Is that directly comparable to your GAAP gross profit guide of $188 million to $208 million or your non-GAAP guide of $200 million to $220 million.

Kris Roy

Yes. The direct comparable would be the non-GAAP.

Daniel Moore

Okay. Perfect. Just wanted to make sure. I think the bags business, switching gears here, that contributed about $35 million in gross profit in 2019. Given that many of these end markets still have a ways to go to fully recover, how would you characterize the recovery of that business? Is bags back to, I don't know, 50% of the gross profit it was generating relative to pre-pandemic? Is it more or less than that? Any directional help you can give there?

Marc Baumann

Sure. No, it's not back to 50% of the pre-pandemic gross profit because, for the most part, if you look at like the curve of mobility and travel activity throughout '21, yes, we had an amazingly strong leisure travel during the summer, and there were some also very strong leisure travel in the fourth quarter. But a lot of things didn't happen.

There was a truncated crew season in Alaska in 2021. There was -- many of our clients at airports and resorts did not bring back all the services, and still haven't. And so, I would say the good news is that we've turned in a performance that is as good as it is for the Company, and yet we still have more recovery story to be told in terms of bringing bags back to where it was pre-pandemic.

So that's really -- there's quite a ways to go there. But as Kris indicated in his earlier remarks, the timing of when that's going to happen really as a function of the decision making that the clients make, because many of them have mothballed certain services as an economy-saving mode. We are pitching new ideas to them, and this is starting to open up. We've talked about curbside concierge. I think we indicated that there's 34 airports where we're operating with one airline. We are in advanced conversations with some other airlines about introducing it for them as well, along with some other services.

So I think you'll -- it will be a steady, gradual path back, but it's not the kind of thing where we're going to be -- even if travelers are traveling at pre-pandemic levels domestically for 2022 that are comparable or above 2019 -- and that's not happening yet -- bags will not be at 2019 levels of activity that is handling because of decisions by its client base. And so, we're going to continue to see recovery in the bags business going into 2023 and potentially into 2024.

Daniel Moore

Okay. That's really helpful, Marc. And I think it's interesting, too, because if your gross profit is almost back to 2019 levels but bags isn't, that means your core business -- I mean, that's clearly showing market share gains in the core business. And I guess that leads me to my next question because that's one of the most common things that comes up in my conversations with investors is the market share gains that you've had.

And now I'm thinking more about the Commercial business. We certainly see total location count ticking up in that business, but I was hoping maybe you could expand a little more and talk about where these contract wins are coming from. Any vertical in particular? And if these share gains are a result of struggling competitors, or are you winning through price? Or are most of these really a result of your technology solutions?

Marc Baumann

Yes. Well, I would say they're mostly the result of the technology solutions. And the technology solutions open up some new opportunities for us, which I'll elaborate on in a minute. But when you talk about verticals, it's a similar story to what we mentioned last quarter. Certain verticals have recovered and are back, for the Commercial segment, above pre-pandemic levels. I'm talking about the profit being generated in those verticals. And so, some of the best vertical recoveries we've seen so far are in the municipal space, the hospital space, and large venues, sporting venues and the like.

We actually added 11 new hospitals in 2021, which was -- it was a great year for hospital wins for us. They finally have stabilized their efforts to focus on COVID treatment and all of that, and they're turning their attention back to trying to find the best possible service providers to support them. Our university space is nearly back to pre-pandemic, and so is our Commercial.

So it's really the two verticals that continue to lag. One is the office buildings, as you might imagine, as companies have spent time reassessing and resetting their expectations to when people come back to the office; and the whole retail mixed use space, which clearly, people have adapted to online shopping. And in some cases, that's having -- the shopping was also taking place where people go to work. And if you're working from home, then you're probably not going to that store that's near where you live.

So those are some of the verticals that we still see will come back. We have a lot of office business, and so I think more and more companies are making commitments about bringing people back, at least on a hybrid schedule, starting here in the next month or two. So I think that will give us a positive uplift on the Commercial group.

Daniel Moore

That's great color.

Kris Roy

Yes, and Tim, just to --

Daniel Moore

Go ahead, Kris.

Kris Roy

Tim, maybe just -- I was just going to say, just to add on to that, you mentioned kind of just the location count, and we're really pleased with kind of the activity that we've been able to see over the last year. And if you look at 2021 from a managed location, we're actually fairly significantly, but let's say maybe 45 locations up on the managed from 2019, which is really good to see in terms of the business coming back. We did have a decrease in the leases, and we've talked about that over the last several quarters here just in terms of looking at those leases and calling the ones that really are unprofitable. So I think we're really happy with our location count in terms of where we landed for the end of the year.

Daniel Moore

Yes. That was really promising to see. We were glad to see that, too. Definitely indicative of the wins and share gains you've been making.

Maybe one more from me. Just a quick one, Kris. Any seasonality to keep in mind for gross profit or earnings for the 2022 quarters as we're all contemplating our models here?

Kris Roy

Yes. I mean, seasonality-wise, Q1 is always our softest, kind of softer quarter if you look at it relative to all the other quarters. That's -- it's generally a softer quarter both on the gross profit side. It kind of translates down into EBITDA. It also translates into kind of lower free cash flow as well. So Q1 is a softer part of the year.

What I would say is that we're kind of getting into that spring break timeframe, and that's really where we start to see the recovery, that seasonality kind of pick up from kind of the slower part of January and first part of February. Spring break typically starts kind of at President's weekend, it kind of works its way through the end of March and into the early part of April.

So far, as we kind of look at the early part of this year, it's kind of coming in as planned. We're not seeing anything that would kind of change how we're thinking about the business. Obviously, we just had our outlook, and we feel good with kind of where we're seeing the numbers come in for the first part of January and a little bit of February.

Daniel Moore

Very promising outlook and good luck in '22, guys.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Marc Riddick from Sidoti.

Marc Riddick

I wanted to go over a couple of things. Certainly, the outlook is certainly ahead of where my numbers were, and it's very encouraging. I was wondering if you could touch on a couple of things.

Wondering, as far as the streamlining of expenses, if you could talk a little bit about how some of those decisions sort of came about, whether that's an offshoot of some of the learnings of the pandemic, or is this sort of based on being able to -- with the technology investments that you made up to this point, having greater profitability from those type of decisions? And then I have a couple of follow-ups after that.

Kris Roy

Yes. I think if you think about the G&A, certainly, there's been a lot of learnings that have come through as it relates to COVID. So there has been us just looking at the business. What I would say, maybe to lead into that is, we thought there was some opportunity to kind of redo things and rethink things in terms of driving cost out of the business. So that was on our radar kind of coming into the pandemic. I think the pandemic kind of accelerated some of those things that we kind of had in mind in terms of opportunities. And I think as we've gone through the pandemic, we've identified some additional opportunities.

And what I would say is, while we're not quite done, I think we're continuing to look at opportunities to continue to drive cost out of the business. I would say that what we'd like to do is to kind of take some of those savings and reinvest it back into the business in terms of, how do we try and reinvest those dollars back into the business to accelerate growth at a faster pace? And then, some of that's going to be through our technology solutions. Some of that's going to be through additional business and development folks. Some of that's going to be just investing in our people in terms of compensation adjustments and the like.

So it's kind of a little bit of everything in terms of coming into the pandemic, going through the pandemic, and as we've come out of the backside, hopefully, of the pandemic, there's been a lot of lessons learned and a lot of opportunity.

Marc Riddick

All right. Next one.

Marc Baumann

I can touch on that. There's always activity --

Marc Riddick

Hello? There we are. Sorry about that. I lost you. Yes, given the outlook that you have for the year, and certainly, that's very positive, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what your thought process is now as far as capital allocation and when we might have an opportunity to -- does it make sense to invest in our shares and how we should be thinking about that for 2022?

Marc Baumann

Sure. I mean, I think we've had a desire over many years, given the high free cash flow generation the Company has, to try to create value for shareholders. And certainly, we have bought back a lot of stock in the past. But I think our focus right now is, are there opportunities for us to take some of the free cash flow -- and you've seen our guidance for 2022 on that, it's a pretty big number. In fact, it's bigger than 2019's record number.

We're looking at -- and of course, it includes the tax refund. But we're looking and saying, are there investments we could make that could accelerate the pace of growth or the transformation, the digital transformation of our industry and our business? And so, I think that represents at least some -- the thought process of looking at, what can we do to further development of our Sphere platform and its capabilities and those sorts of things.

So we'll take it one step at a time. We're going to be generating a lot of cash. We understand that after being highly leveraged last year during the pandemic, we've now come back down into the normal range for our business. We're into this -- about to be in the 2x to 3x level. And so, it does give us the chance to look for ways to accelerate growth because -- but I think we feel the best way to create value for shareholders is to try to grow faster. And that means doing the things that can drive our top line and, of course, our EBITDA.

Marc Riddick

Excellent. And then one last thing from me. I was wondering if you'd talk a little bit about the -- where we are on gateless locations and what you think we might see this year.

Marc Baumann

I was thinking about that earlier. I don't have that number in front of me, but we are well, well down the track. I mean, I think it's 600 or more gateless locations at this point. And so, we're -- we still have a ways to go. There's more where this technology can be deployed in terms of our existing portfolio. We also have the gated solution, which uses a lot of the same technology but provides access control to ensure that people are actually paying when they park.

I think probably the most exciting sort of new development is there are lots and lots of places where -- and many of these are not in the downtown business core -- where employees or others, vendors and service providers and the like, take all the good parking spots. And that might be at a hotel, it might be at a shopping center or the like, and we are starting to have great experiences in deploying our day lift solution. And all that really means is the mobile app and some signs with QR codes and generating revenue. And most importantly, creating a premium space for the best customers to park in.

So I think that represents a growth opportunity for us that maybe 12 months ago, we hadn't even contemplated for this technology. And there are, of course, literally thousands and thousands of places out there. And I just -- I've got the number now. It's 500 locations for the gate list. But given what I just said about the scope of and the utilization of that technology, we have a fairly, let's call it, low penetration vis-a-vis the business opportunity for that.

Marc Riddick

And then the last one for me, and this is sort of a little squishy, Marc, so I apologize before I ask it. But one of the main questions that we get is around tying the Company to a reversal of work-from-home activity and the like. And certainly, given the outlook that you have in some of the commentary that you had already, I was wondering if you could sort of give sort of a general overview of sort of maybe what thoughts you had going into the setting of outlook numbers and kind of what kind of environment you're either expecting or what have you. Because certainly, that's one of the things that gets tied in for a lot of investors, and I would love to hear your updated thoughts on that.

Marc Baumann

Yes, sure. And I mean, look, the way we budget, it's a way that has served, I think, the Company well for a long, long time, and that is at the location level, because every contract has some unique attributes to it. Some have fixed and variable components, some are leases, et cetera. Some serve commercial office buildings, and some serve other places as well. They're not just limited to one type of place or reason why people go somewhere.

So I think what we can say is that gross profit for Q4 for the office building segment in commercial was about 75% of 2019, so it's not like everybody's home and nobody's going to the office. I mean, you might read that kind of thing, it's 30%, 40%. But when people do go in, they're generating more revenue because they're not buying monthly parking, and monthly parking is discounted parking.

So we're not super far away from getting back to 2019 gross profit in that segment, and part of it is because we've added new locations. And part of it is because of what I just said about the way parking is paid for. So we can easily get back and exceed 2019 gross profit from the office segment without everybody returning to the office five days a week. That's not going to happen anyway.

Marc Riddick

Couldn't have said it better.

Operator

Next on queue is Kevin Steinke from Barrington Research.

Kevin Steinke

I just wanted to ask about -- obviously, a really solid outlook for 2022. But as you look at the top and bottom ends of the range that you provided for 2022, what are some of the factors you're thinking about that might get you to either end of the range? Is it mostly about the pace of recovery, new business wins, or what other factors might we think about playing into that range?

Kris Roy

Yes. Kevin, this is Kris. I think it's kind of a combination of all the above, right? I think you're going to start to see -- and Marc kind of mentioned this -- I think you're starting to see people return back to the office, and I think you're going to start to see some continued recovery. I think some verticals, as Marc mentioned, have maybe recovered a little quicker than other verticals. If you look at stadiums when you're watching the TV sporting event, certainly, those stands are full. If you come down into the office space, it's probably less full. So I think -- but I think you're going to start to see some of those recovery trends continue into other verticals that will certainly help us in 2022.

And then, I think as we look to new locations, certainly we want to increase our market penetration. And I really look to Sphere, in that the technology that we're able to provide has really resonated with our client base, and I think they're looking at it and just saying, how can we use more of the Sphere ecosystem? And that really kind of has two kind of primary components to it. One, it reduces friction, right? Nobody really wants to have that friction experience. And then, the second item is, it can certainly provide opportunities for the client in terms of aggregating their parkers, aggregating information.

So I think at the end of the day, you're going to see kind of a mix of both. You're going to see the recovery in terms of new business, you're going to see the recovery that's just going to happen naturally as we kind of move -- continue to move through the pandemic.

Kevin Steinke

All right. That makes sense. And as we think about your technology investments in 2022, continuing to really focus on that, are there any specific areas that you really want to continue to develop? And do you think that can be done all internally and organically? Or is it -- does it make sense to kind of look at the acquisition landscape from a technology perspective and see if you could add to your capabilities through that avenue as well.

Marc Baumann

Sure. Well, I think fundamentally, we all are experiencing use of mobile apps to pay for transactions and have low -- hopefully, low-friction experiences. And so, we're continuously monitoring what functionality capability other mobile apps provide for people using those services. And that's not limited to just the parking industry or the shuttle bus industry or other industries where we provide services.

And so, we're looking at those things, and our team and I have -- our team that works on these things and I and our operating guys, we've all talked about the same thing. If our client values it, we need to have it. And that means we have to continuously be in dialogue with our clients about what they value, what their expectations are, how are things changing for their businesses, how can we help them achieve their objectives. That's the most important thing. That's why we -- what we exist to do, is to serve that client base.

And when we add that information, then we look for ways to try to deliver on that as quickly as possible. And that might mean we develop it ourselves. In some cases, that might mean we acquire some functionality from somebody and fold it into our platform. In some cases, we might partner with somebody who's got a solution, and we can get to market faster. So it's never a one-size-fits-all.

So there will be new functionality coming out and we're -- it's too numerous to mention now, but you'll see it. And if they're significant, we'll talk about them publicly, for sure. But the idea is simply to reduce the amount of friction in mobility. And those -- that's the focus.

Now, the other side of our business, pre-pandemic, as Kris indicated earlier, we thought we were pretty efficient. We've spent money on technology to make our support functions and back office as efficient as we could. But given the pandemic gave us a little bit of time to have a reexamination of things, we identified some areas where we felt that we could do more. And some of this involves taking manual processes out of the equation.

And, as it always comes down to, it's like, how do you get the information and the data that's at the parking facility or other facility we operate into our systems? Bear in mind that the technology at the facility is not owned by us; it's our clients' equipment. And so, we have lots of ways that we do that, and some of that is fully automated and just uploaded to the cloud, and some of that involves manual processes.

So there's definitely opportunities for us to streamline a lot of that, automate more of that, and make that more efficient. And we're spending time and effort on that. And I think those are the kind of things that can reduce errors, get us -- capture more of the revenue, but also reduce our G&A costs as we go forward.

Kevin Steinke

Okay. Really interesting and helpful commentary. Congratulations on the results. And that's all I had.

Operator

Next one on the queue is Daniel Moore from CJS Securities.

Daniel Moore

Just a little housekeeping. This might be obvious and I missed it. What does the CapEx expectations embedded in the free cash flow guide? And Marc, clearly, your focus is on internal investments, which have paid off handsomely here in the near -- so far in the near term. Are there M&A and/or technology tuck-ins that you might look at as well? As the balance sheet continues to improve, you could be down to as low as 2x leverage based on the free cash flow guide by year-end.

Marc Baumann

I'll let Kris take the first part there and talk about CapEx, and then I'll come back to our sort of approach and how we're thinking about the technology development.

Kris Roy

Yes. I think, Dan, if you look at CapEx for '22, I think the $10 million to $15 million range is kind of where we're at, which is probably about the norm of -- in terms of what we would generally have in terms of a range, maybe a little bit higher as we continue to make some investments in Sphere, but kind of right in the same range that we've been in for the last couple of years.

Marc Baumann

And I think in terms of technology -- sorry, I'm just getting over a cold -- we have a pretty clear picture that is derived from what I was explaining to Kevin. And that is, what are our clients' expectations for technology? What is the market need for technology? What do clients value, and what are really looking to have as part of the portfolio of technology platform? And how does that compare to what our platform can do at any point in time?

And so, we have a -- we definitely -- no platform is ever fully developed. There will always be some gap of some kind or another. And when we take a look at what those gaps are, and we say, if we close that gap, how does that help us generate more gross profit and EBITDA for the Company? And what will it cost to close that gap if we go out and acquire that capability from someone who already has it? What will it cost -- what will be the economic arrangement if we partner with somebody to simply provide that capability? Or, if we want to develop it ourselves, what will it cost and how long it will take? And there's a market opportunity cost, too, of moving at a certain pace.

So I would just say that our goal is to have no meaningful gaps that create profit market opportunities for us with technology in the space we operate. And we're always continuously looking at all of the ways that we might close those gaps. And we are definitely not a one-size-fits-all solution provider. We have competitors out there who tout their one solution to all situations, and that's not going to work in a lot of cases.

And then we have other people who say, well, I'll just go and use somebody else's technology and hope that they can provide the needs that a client has. Our goal is to satisfy clients. And that means that we will develop stuff ourselves. But in many cases, we will -- there will be some partners out there or others that can help us move faster, and we're going to then look at potentially acquiring that capability if that gets us down to where we want to be faster.

Daniel Moore

All right. Very helpful for all the color and feel better. Appreciate it.

Operator

And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over back to Marc Baumann.

Marc Baumann

Okay, Chino. Thank you so much. And we're obviously thrilled with the way the year ended. It was a great year for us, certainly ended and progressed much better than we might have thought a year ago, when we were starting out and gave our original guidance for the year. And obviously, we have big expectations for 2022. But as always, we're very focused on driving growth, driving faster growth, and utilizing technology to really differentiate ourselves in the marketplace.

So thank you for being with us today, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

His trip was going smoothly—almost too smoothly, he thought. He would hum along for a few hundred miles at a time, stopping briefly for meals or to take in the early summer scenery. It was the classic Great American road trip. And it was hardly remarkable at all that he was doing it in an electric car.

Viswanathan, a scientist at Carnegie Mellon University, is an expert in high-energy-density batteries—designs that are meant to pack a lot of juice into not a lot of space. At times, this involves chemistry that can feel almost fanciful; the unobtanium of battery tech. But after that summer being propelled cross-country by a totally obtainable battery, he began to consider a different application for his work. “I was like, ‘Wait, what am I doing with all these new batteries I’m inventing?’” Viswanathan recalls. “Who is going to need them?” There was another way to travel coast-to-coast, he realized, one that batteries were far from decarbonizing: flight.

Over the past few years, the battery industry has largely focused on cars, yielding steady, incremental improvements to a particular scientific approach. This involves lithium ions that move between a cathode composed of a few metal oxides—including nickel, cobalt, manganese, and iron—and an anode made of graphite. This classic recipe has gotten pretty good. Recently, lithium-ion batteries have pushed the range of passenger cars past 400 miles—about as good as many combustion engines, and enough to overcome the “range anxiety” that might make some drivers reluctant to go electric. But as they approach the theoretical limit of how much energy they can store, lithium-ion batteries remain well short of what’s required for most aircraft.

The aviation industry has been grappling with this problem for a while. The industry contributes about 2 percent of global carbon emissions—a relatively small figure, but one that is poised to grow sharply as more of the world takes to the skies. (Only about one in 10 people take a flight each year, and a 2018 study estimated that 1 percent of the world’s population is responsible for half of aviation emissions.) If those planes are going to go electric, Viswanathan believes, batteries will need a radical rethink. Even regional jets meant for relatively short hops require batteries that are light but sufficiently powerful. They need enough power for takeoff, then enough energy to safely cruise over long distances. It’s possible that it will never be practical—and that greener aviation will require other approaches, like hydrogen or synthetic jet fuel.

Or by rethinking some battery fundamentals. Last week, along with other battery and aviation experts, Viswanathan published in Nature what he considers a “wake-up call” to the industry to invest in basic science beyond moving around lithium ions. In particular, the authors advocate for new cathodes involving more exotic materials, some of which produce what are known as conversion reactions, which move more electrons and can potentially pack more energy. It’s stuff that people haven’t really considered since the 1970s, when cobalt started to win out. The US Department of Energy project has set a goal of building a battery that can hold 500 watt-hours of energy per kilogram. Viswanathan and his coauthors think that for a workhorse of the skies, like the Boeing 737, we’ll need to double that, and we’ll need new chemistries to get us there. “We’re trying to move the goalpost,” he says.

The lithium-ion battery is a chemical love story. Lithium ions and electrons, once separated from each other by a charge, always seek to be reunited. The wandering of these electrons across a battery cell is what generates a current. But in that sense, lithium is limited because it has only one electron to give up. In theory, more electrons moving around would mean more energy, which is something other elements can potentially offer. Try iodine, maybe, or sulfur or fluorine, and you can get more electrons buzzing."

Secondly, SXSW is coming up and I will be there IRL. Reach out if there’s a talk or presentation you believe I simply must see or a person I just have to meet. It’ll be a quick trip, but I am looking for any and all compelling transportation goings on. I am also moderating two panels: one is on sustainable mobility with folks from Arrival, Uber and autonomous vehicle consultant Selika Talbott. The other one, with Enel and Uber, is focused on EV charging infrastructure and the electrification of ride sharing, corporate fleets and service fleets.

Bah! wait, how could I forget … this is huge and finally we can have cars in the U.S. that don’t blind people!

Micromobbin’

One of my favorite podcast and newsletter hosts, Azeem Azhar, dedicated a whole podcast to micromobility! On his latest show, Exponential View, where Azhar explores the impact of technology on business and society, he had on micromobility expert Horace Dediu. They talked about the role of software in driving the adoption of micromobility (a trend that some people questioned and even gave me a lot of flack for writing about a year ago), the integration of AR and micromobility and how big tech companies will integrate into micromobility.

There’s really no end to the companies trying to fuel the micromobility revolution, so catch up with just a few of them here.

Cogo is consolidating a less talked-about market in the micromobility world: shared mobility aggregating. The company just acquired another aggregator, eScoot, so that it can better offer comprehensive price comparisons for shared mobility. This helps users check the price, availability and travel time from multiple operators in one search. Funnily enough, this is something Dediu has said big tech companies, like Google, have an opportunity to capitalize on via Maps, so we’ll see how this kind of service unfolds in the long run.

Bird is extending its permits and increasing its fleet size in a few markets. It’ll be sticking around a little while longer in Long Beach, Portland and Decatur, and adding more vehicles to Durham, Isla Vista and Arlington.

Mundimoto, an online motorcycle buying and selling startup, raised $22.6 million to expand its platform outside of Spain and into the rest of Europe.

Lyft is starting to double down on its bikeshare business, per its Q4 2021 earnings. This supports comments that Tony Ho of Segway made to TechCrunch last year when he forecast that some of the “big rideshare guys” would be “coming back to play.”

Lightning Motorcycles is designing an electric two-wheeler that has a top speed of 250 mph (!!!). It’ll need a special metal called niobium that is found on rocket ships.

Deal of the week

This isn’t a deal, so much as a rumored one. Still, it’s worth noting because of the implications.

German media reported that Volkswagen is in talks with Huawei to acquire the latter’s nascent autonomous driving unit for billions of euros. Huawei said it had no immediate comment when contacted by TechCrunch. VW China said it has no comment.

As TC reporter Rita Liao notes, the potential merger will be a powerful one. Huawei’s autonomous unit sits under the telecom equipment and smartphone behemoth’s “smart vehicle solution” business unit, which started only in 2019. The founding of the smart car BU spurred much speculation over whether Huawei would develop its own cars, though the firm has repeatedly denied any manufacturing plans and said it instead wants to be the “Bosch of China”, or a components supplier for car brands.

Other deals that got my attention this week …

Carbar, the Australian car subscription company, raised $28.9 million in a round led by Insurance Australia Group and Seven West Media.

CelLink, a California startup that developed a way to replace traditional wiring harnesses in vehicles, raised $250 million in a funding round backed by several strategic investors, including BMW iVentures, Lear Corp., Robert Bosch Venture Capital and 3M. Previous investor Ford Motor did not join the latest round.

Cepton, a lidar company that went public via a merger with SPAC partner Growth Capital Acquisition Corp, held its opening bell ringing ceremony at Nasdaq on February 17.

Haul, a company that developed software to connect CDL drivers to trucking companies with assignments, announced it raised $10 million in a round led by B Capital Group. Other investors included previous funders, Hack VC, Next Coast Ventures, Pipeline Capital Partners, RPM Ventures, Value Chain Ventures, as well as new participants, Bam Elevate, FJ Labs, WTI and angel investor Will Redd (cofounder of ZipRecruiter).

Ibex Investors has a new $113 million fund focused on early-stage mobility companies. The firm, which is based in Denver with offices in New York and Tel Aviv, has already tapped into the fund to invest in Aifleet and Visionary.ai.

Liefergrün, a German-based startup that offers emissions-free last-mile delivery services, raised €3 million in a seed funding round led by SpeedInvest and with participation from Norrsken VC.

Motorq, a connected car API startup, said it raised $40 million in a Series B funding round led by Insight Partners. Existing investors also joined including Story Ventures, FM Capital, Monta Vista Capital and Avanta Ventures.

Parallel Systems, an autonomous electric rail company, received $4.5 million in grant money from the Department of Energy as part of its Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy initiative.

RideCo, a Canadian company offering cities on-demand transit tech, closed a $15.8 million (CAD $20 million) Series A round. RideCo’s funding round, which was led by Eclipse Ventures, represents the first time the company has raised institutional investment in the seven years since its founding.

Notable news and other tidbits

Autonomous vehicles

Argo AI is launching a new engineering and development office in Los Angeles where researchers will engage in R&D to advance its self-driving tech. Argo is bringing on Caltech professor Yisong Yue as principal scientist, who bring an expertise in ML and a connection to the university. Argo’s new office is close by Caltech, which will allow Argo to tap into that university-to-startup pipeline.

Aurora announced in a blog post that it is partnering with USXpress “to design optimal deployment strategies for autonomous technology in its commercial operations.” Think of this as a data exchange mission to find the lanes that would most benefit from early deployment of Aurora’s self-driving trucking technology.

Separately, Aurora reported its first earnings (Q4 and full year) as a publicly traded company. There weren’t too many surprises for a company that is still developing its technology and therefore pre-revenue. It’s R&D spend caught my eye though. Whooo weee! Aurora reported it spent $697.3 million on research and development in 2021, compared to $179.4 million in 2020. Aurora has $1.6 billion in cash on hand.

Baidu is launching its autonomous ride-hailing service, Apollo Go, in yet another city. Shenzhen will be the company’s seventh city where it’s introduced robotaxi services, starting with the Nanshan District, which is home to companies like Huawei and Tencent, as well as many tourist attractions. The company will be deploying Apollo’s 4th gen vehicle, the Hongqi EV, and has promised to bring its 5th gen robotaxi onto the fleet soon. Users will be able to hail a robotaxi via the Apollo Go app at one of 50 stations from 9am to 5pm. Baidu hopes to expand to more than 300 stations by the end of the year.

Important to note: This is still a trial operation. Baidu has gone commercial in Beijing and will be bringing a commercial service to Cangzhou in March. The Shenzhen service will also involve “drivered” autonomous vehicles (human safety operator is still behind the wheel) while Baidu seeks permission to test driverless in the city.

Cruise plans to expand the self-driving delivery pilot it has with Walmart in Arizona to eight stores. Today, that pilot involves just one Walmart store located on Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community lands near Scottsdale.

Starship Technologies launched an on-demand delivery service in Pleasanton, California, which is in the Bay Area. This is an expansion of its existing partnership deploying autonomous sidewalk robots for The Save Mart companies, which began in 2020.

Waymo’s autonomous trucking and cargo division Waymo Via and freight logistics company C.H. Robinson are gearing up to launch a pilot. The companies said within the coming months Waymo’s test fleet will be delivering freight in Texas for one of C.H. Robinson’s customers. The pilot is part of a larger partnership between the two companies that aims to combine Waymo’s AV technology, which is available to any carrier, with C.H. Robinson’s logistics data on over 3 million trucking lanes and access to a network of nearly 200,000 shippers and carriers, many of which are medium and small carriers that Waymo is interested in reaching.

Electric vehicles

Remember all of those electric vehicle ads that aired during the Super Bowl? Apparently, Cars.com saw an 80% increase in EV page views after all that marketing. TechCrunch reporter Rebecca Bellan tells me she loved this ad from General Motors, featuring Dr. Evil and crew from the Austin Powers movies, in part because it went nicely with the throwbacks from the halftime show.

Putting aside my Gen Xer reaction to the word “throwbacks” (we’ll talk later, Rebecca) I was struck by how many of the EVs in these ads are not yet on sale. When all those people turned to the internet to find these EVs were they disappointed? Or excited for what was to come?

Delorean is coming back as an EV! Or at least that’s the intention of some Texas executives who are working with Stephen Wynne, Bloomberg reported. Wynne owns the DeLorean branding rights and supplies parts for the 6,000 or so remaining vehicles. DeLorean Motor Company ReImagined LLC tweeted out a video that teases the upcoming EV; no word on timing.

Fisker confirmed in an earnings call that it’s still on track to start production of the Ocean SUV in November, with reservations for its first electric vehicle jumping to 31,000. Interestingly, there are 1,600 fleet reservations for the Ocean, including an incremental 200-unit order from software company ServiceNow.

Redwood Materials, the startup founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, is launching an electric vehicle battery recycling program in California with Ford and Volvo as inaugural partners as pressure mounts to source materials for EVs. The two automakers will cover some of the cost of retrieving, properly packaging and then transporting the batteries back to Redwood’s recycling facility in northern Nevada.

The program will be free for those turning in vehicle batteries. Redwood says it will accept all lithium-ion and nickel metal hydride batteries in the state, regardless of the make or model of the vehicle.

Tesla said non-Tesla owners can charge their electric vehicles at all Supercharger stations in the Netherlands, marking an expansion of a pilot program that kicked off in November 2021 with 10 stations.

Speaking of Tesla, the company fell seven spots to No. 23 out of 32 brands in Consumer Reports’ annual auto brand rankings. And not to pile on, but … federal safety regulators opened an investigation into Tesla after receiving hundreds of reports alleging “phantom braking.” The investigation covers an estimated 416,000 Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles from the 2021-22 model years.

Volta is expanding its collaboration with Walgreens and will install 1,000 DC fast charging stalls at over stores throughout the U.S.

Future of flight

AirAsia signed a non-binding MoU with Avolon, an aircraft leasing company, to lease a minimum of 100 eVTOLs that were built by Vertical Aerospace.

AutoFlight, a Chinese eVTOL company, completed the proof-of-concept, transition test flight for its air taxi Prosperity I, in which the aircraft switches from a vertical take-off motion to horizontal flight and back to vertical flight before landing — an important milestone for an eVTOL startup trying to make it in the business.

Joby Aviation is partnering with Japanese airline ANA to bring aerial ridesharing services to Japan. Toyota Motor Corporation will be partnering with the two companies, as well, in order to explore ways to connect the air taxis to ground-based transportation. In other Joby news, the company reported one of its test vehicles crashed. NTSB is investigating.

Gig economy and delivery

Doordash is launching express grocery delivery, which brings customer groceries in under 30 minutes, in partnership with Albertsons, which owns stores like Safeway, Vons, Tom Thumb, ACME Markets and more.

In-vehicle tech

Nvidia keeps scoring those automaker partnerships. This time, it is Jaguar Land Rover. The automaker said it will use Nvidia’s end-to-end Drive Hyperion platform in all of its vehicles starting in 2025. This platform will be used to power features like advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving.

People stuff

Caribou, the auto fintech startup formerly called MotoRefi, has hired or promoted 10 new executives. The company promoted former COO and Uber alum Eric Stradley to the role of president, appointed Jason Tepperman as chief lending officer, hired Arlene Dzurnak as the company’s chief compliance officer and named Jennifer Khazai chief accounting officer.

P.J. O’Rourke, the satirist and bestselling author who also wrote for Car and Driver, died February 15. Car and Driver has a nice send off piece featuring some of his work for the magazine.

Steve Taub left In-Q-Tel, where he was partner, and is now managing director of investments at JetBlue Technology Ventures.

Virgin Galactic announced that Chairman Chamath Palihapitiya, whose SPAC took the company public in 2019, is stepping down from the space-tourism company’s board of directors, effective immediately, CNBC reported."

Gentex Corporation (GNTX) generates 98% of its revenues selling products to the auto OEMs, mainly its auto-dimming mirrors in which it has a 94% market share. The company is trying to diversify by entering different verticals such as the aviation and healthcare verticals. GNTX's strong balance sheet, moaty product and heavy R&D investments will likely ensure its success in the foreseeable future. The shares are worth anywhere from $34 to $43 depending on GNTX's success entering the new verticals. But even in the conservative scenario, you would own a great company that offers an 8% capital appreciation and 1.5% dividend yield.

Bears says the demand for the product will decline with autonomous driving, however, there are three reasons that do not support that thesis. First, mirrors are a relatively cheap way to have redundant safety measures in the vehicle. Second, GNTX is in the business of cameras as well, so even if mirrors play a smaller role in autonomous cars, GNTX will compensate for the decline in mirrors with camera sales, and keep in mind that cameras cost more. Thirdly, cars are underpenetrated, only a third of cars have interior auto-dimming mirrors and only a fifth have exterior auto-dimming mirrors. As those mirrors are safer than regular mirrors, I see OEMs increasing the penetration of auto-dimming mirrors in their products.

4Q21 & FY Earnings

Even though the production of light vehicles declined 3% in 2021, GNTX was able to grow its revenues by 3% to 1.73B USD. The demand for the Full Display Mirror units was high in the year, in fact, the shipment of these units grew by 7% in the year. However, 4Q21 results were impacted by the chip shortage. Revenues declined 20.8% to 419.8M USD driven by the 20% decline in light vehicle production. On the smaller segments, GNTX showed interesting results. For example, the aircraft windows and fire protection products grew 23% and 32% respectively.

Gross margin declined 100bps to 34.3% vs 3Q21 due to product mix, labour and chip shortages, raw material inflation, freight-related costs and labour inefficiencies due to last-minute changes in customer demand. In the earnings call, management expressed that those issues should be resolved by the second semester of 2022.

Also, thanks to its strong balance sheet with substantial cash and no debt, GNTX returned 439.9M USD to shareholders via maintaining the dividend and repurchasing 9.6M shares at an average price of $33.83 per share.

R&D Paying Off

Most of GNTX revenues are generated from the auto business, roughly 98% of revenues. However, they are diversifying into other verticals. GNTX is selling auto-dimming windows to Boeing and Airbus, developing healthcare products by partnering with the Mayo clinic, developing glasses for the visually impaired just to name some of the R&D initiatives. The heavy investment of the company in R&D, 6.5% of revenues, will ensure the company stays relevant in this changing market.

Dividend

Since 2003, GNTX has been increasing the dividend every year except for 2010 and 2021. But even during the pandemic, GNTX maintained its dividend at $0.12 per quarter. GNTX has 267.7M USD in cash and no debt so I think the dividend is very safe and actually management may accelerate the share repurchasing plan to take advantage of the current stock price.

Seeking Alpha

2022 Guidance

As GNTX is very dependent on light vehicle production, the guidance is based on an assumption on light vehicle production. They are depending on the IHS Markit forecast which assumed an 8% growth in production in 2022 reaching 69.4M vehicles. By 2023, they forecast production to grow by 10% to 76.6M vehicles produced.

For 2022, management expects revenues to grow 8% to 17%. This implies that GNTX will outpace the growth of light vehicles by increasing its penetration with OEMs and growth in the new segments such as the airplane-windows business. The same is true for 2023, management expects revenue to grow 15% to 20% while vehicle production will 'only' grow 10%.

As per gross margin, they expect margins to maintain or to slightly deteriorate from the current 35.8% margin to 35% to 36%. This is understandable as they expect the headwinds mentioned above only to be solved by the second semester of the year.

Capex guidance is more than doubling to a range from 150M USD to 175M USD. The reason for the significant increase is threefold. First, there is a capacity issue to satisfy the expected growth in 2022 and 2023. Second, all the new products they are launching our new product lines and that requires extra capex. Finally, 25M USD of that capex is in fact capex planned for 2021 but was postponed due to the shortages.

Valuation

I used a WACC of 8.8% based on an unlevered beta of 1.21 for the auto parts sector and a debt-to-equity ratio of zero. The value per share is $34 based on the following assumptions.

Author estimates

I assumed revenues growth in line with management's guidance for 2022 and 2023, then tapering to 2%. This is a very conservative assumption, since its inception, GNTX has grown revenues at an annual average of 19.6% and 5.6% in the last 10 years. The heavy investment in R&D will ensure GNTX's relevancy in the market moving forward. If I assume low-double-digit growth up to 2027, the value per share easily increases to $43 per share.

YCharts

Conclusion

GNTX is a company I would buy and accumulate forever. It has a great product, continuously innovates, hoards cash, has no debt, pays a predictable dividend that grew in 16 of the 18-year history and repurchases shares opportunistically.

Global Drone Package Delivery Market Overview

Quickly the latest technological developments in self-determining unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) and developed regulations may soon open the way for their high-scale implementation in the drone package delivery of products. The use of drones could drastically diminish labor costs and has been absorbed as a potential disruptor to the parcel delivery industry. E-commerce retailers and delivery companies such as Flipkart, Amazon, and others are already filing up patents for the development of multi-level fulfillment centers for unmanned aerial vehicles or ""drone-beehives"" that would allow the deployment of this technology within the built environment.

Stream in the utilization of the internet of things (IoT) in drone delivery systems, demand for faster delivery, an increase in carbon emission-free transport solutions are the elements that drive the global Drone Package Delivery Market. Moreover, limited drone operability in grating weather and near high-rise buildings hinder the market growth.

Presently, drone delivery services are in their developing stage. The costs related to operations are climbing because of its latest technology, and it has limitations on the amount of weight and areas of use. Ongoing, the weight that a typical drone can carry ranges between 1 and 12 kg, while the delivery distance range is somewhere between 1 and 25 km. The absence of infrastructure due to their high investment cost is restraining the growth of the drone delivery services market.

Isabel Green

00:03 Hello, and welcome, everyone to our 2021 Full Year Results Presentation. I'm Isabel Green, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our Chair, Anita Frew; our CEO, Warren East; and our CFO, Panos Kakoullis.

00:14 Before we present our results, I'll hand over to Anita to say a few words on our other announcement this morning.

Anita Frew

00:21 Thank you, Isabel and good morning, everyone. You will have seen our announcement this morning that Warren plans to step down at the end of this year. By then, Warren will have spent nine years on the Board and almost eight years as CEO, a relatively long tenure and a tribute to his strength and commitment. As a result, we are now starting and open a transparent search process for Warren's successor.

00:43 Warren has a real passion for the business which engenders pride in our people and confidence among our stakeholders. In his time at Rolls-Royce he has created a dramatically different business and has positioned us well to generate substantial value from the drive to net zero. Finally, I would just like to thank Warren on behalf of the whole Board for his tremendous work. It's not over yet though. I know that while we carry out the search for his successor, Warren will continue to lead Rolls-Royce with all the dedication he has shown throughout this time at Rolls-Royce.

01:16 I now hand back to Isabel to introduce today's results.

Isabel Green

01:19 Thank you, Anita. Today's presentation will begin with a summary of our improving performance and an update on our commitments from Warren, before handing over to Panos for a more detailed review of our financial results. Warren will then conclude with an update on our ambition to sustainable growth and value creation. In all, our presentation should take around 40 minutes leaving time at the end for Warren and Panos to take your questions.

01:44 Before we begin, please take note of the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. As always, the full set of results, materials can be downloaded from the Investor Relations section of our website.

01:52 I'll now hand over to Warren.

Warren East

02:01 Thank you and good morning, everyone. And we appreciate you joining us on what I know is a very busy day for many of you. Now as Anita mentioned, I have decided to step down at the end of this year. I'm extremely proud of what all of us at Rolls-Royce have achieved since I joined the company. Rolls-Royce today is culturally and strategically a very different business. We're also a completely different organization commercially and operationally, much more efficient and productive with sound operational gearing that will create value from additional growth.

02:33 I'm sure you'll see some of that in our results presentation this morning. You will also see that we have a clear vision and direction to lead the transition to net zero and we're already seizing opportunities with tremendous future potential. I understand no Chief Executives job is ever really complete, but I feel that with the advances we've made and the momentum and energy we've shown and our firmer financial foundations now is the right time to look for the future. Now, there will be a time for reflection at a later date, right now, as you would expect, I'm fully committed to leading the business. So let's get on and we'll talk about that.

03:11 So let's look at where we've got to and turn to the results for last year. I would like to start by celebrating what an important year it has been for Rolls-Royce and to think about some of my own personal highlights from 2021. Now in November, I joined my colleagues at COP26. A few years ago, we wouldn't have even had Rolls-Royce at the Climate Conference, but today our business and the future of our business is all about the energy transition.

03:37 In the picture on the left of the slide, I'm with the nuclear for climate team. You can see they represent the young workers of today and they are drawn from multiple nations all working in the nuclear industry. They're all really passionate about protecting the world, their world, from the negative impacts of climate change and they are concerned about the positive contribution that nuclear can make to the future energy mix. It was particularly encouraging to speak with them and many others at COP26 about the need for our technologies in this space and in particular the role for our SMRs.

04:14 Furthermore, we showcased a number of our technologies in the green zone, as you can see in the photo on the top right of this slide. Exhibits included our double world record breaking Spirit of Innovation aircraft, which helped visitors to understand how we at Rolls-Royce can be part of the climate change solution.

04:30 However, it's not just our new businesses that we should celebrate, our established businesses are also driving our journey to net zero and the image here on the bottom right shows the launch of one of our latest MTU hydrogen fuel cells in a microgrid at our facilities in Friedrichshafen. That's it being switched on for the very first time. It took six months for the microgrid demonstrator to go from decision to commissioning of the first MTU battery energy storage system and that's a great example of our agility and how quickly we're delivering new solutions.

05:06 Let's move on now to our 2021 operational performance highlights. I begin by focusing on Civil and in particular the restructuring program and this was an enormous undertaking, building on earlier productivity and efficiency programs. It's really transformed our Civil Aerospace business. The picture here is -- of a programmable machine tools at our turbine blade facility in Derby.

05:31 These machines have been transferred across from Crosspointe in the U.S. and they can easily switch between designs and have absolutely minimal manual oversight. This means one person can now do the work of several previously and what used to be a time-consuming manual setup is now fast, it's largely software, creating flexibility as well as much greater throughput and that's just one example.

05:56 Moving on in Defence, we're very proud to have been awarded the B-52 engine replacement program in the U.S. This award secures new business for the coming decades after entry into service in the late 2020s and it's a huge achievement for our Defence colleagues and I'll talk more about Defence opportunities later in the presentation.

06:15 In Power Systems, you will remember at the half year we were seeing orders well ahead of the year before and in the second half of 2021 order intake accelerated with record order intake in the fourth quarter, giving us the largest order book in Power Systems history.

06:34 And moving to the bottom of the slide, in Rolls-Royce Electrical, we're thrilled with the success of our two world records with the Spirit of Innovation aircraft. This demonstrates the real pace at which electrical technology is accelerating into the world of aviation and creating new opportunities. We're excited to be exploring the varied applications for air mobility.

06:56 In the middle at the bottom, in Rolls-Royce SMR, as you know, we decided some time ago to focus our Civil Nuclear activities on SMRs small modular reactors. In the second half of the year, we secured UK Government grant support alongside equity investment to progress the project to the next phase.

07:14 And, last, in the bottom corner, but certainly not least, we're making good progress with disposals. Back in October 2020, we committed to undertaking a series of disposals to reshape our balance sheet. Three of these disposals have already completed and the sale of ITP Aero is agreed, it's announced and it's expected to complete this year.

07:35 Let's have a look at our financial summary. We have three great outcomes from the progress we made in 2021. One, we have improved financial performance. Two, we are delivering on our commitments, and three, we're still investing for growth and sustainable value. Our cost reductions and market growth have helped us to return to profitability in 2021.

07:59 And while we still had a cash outflow in the year, you can see from the histogram on the left of the slide, this was substantially improved from 2020 and is expected -- and is ahead of expectations. And as mentioned in -- a moment ago, our restructuring program has delivered more than GBP1.3 billion run rate savings and our disposals are on track to achieve the total proceeds of around GBP2 billion.

08:26 Our sustained investments in research and development is enabling us to deliver market-leading technology focused on net zero and this unlocks opportunities to deliver long-term and sustainable value in both our established businesses and the new ones that we're reporting on separately for the first time today. And our ability to maintain investment even in these difficult times is supported by a strong liquidity position with no debt maturities before 2024.

08:56 And moving on to the next slide, I'm going to add some color on just a couple of topics. Let's start with the restructuring program. The activity here was mostly about Civil Aerospace. It was about rightsizing in the short-term and then taking advantage of efficiency and productivity enhancements, so that we can scale up output without a corresponding increase in operating costs. Not only have we exceeded our run rate savings target and we've removed more than 9,000 roles across the group and we have done so one year ahead of schedule.

09:31 Our Civil business operation is now about a third smaller than it was in terms of footprint and headcount and that makes Civil leaner, a much more efficient and productive business and one that is ready for future growth. The focus now is on ensuring the benefits we've achieved are sustained. Now some pictures of friendly faces.

09:53 Before passing over to Panos, I'd just like to take a moment to focus on our executive team. The real breadth of experience and expertise is enhanced by these recent additions. So, last May, we mentioned we welcomed Panos Kakoullis, our CFO, who joined us from Deloitte with over 30 years’ experience of managing large multinational, multi-disciplinary teams, helping major organizations to deliver change.

10:20 Top right of the slide, Grazia Vittadini has joined us as Chief Technology and Strategy Officer. Grazia brings to us extensive expertise in both aerospace and the emerging and disruptive technologies from -- amongst other things, her 20 years’ experience with Airbus latterly as their CTO. I think it's important that a balanced team brings a combination of fresh-thinking from outside the organization, but also deep knowledge from within the organization.

10:47 It's important to also to demonstrate to others internally that career development to the very top level is just part of how we do things around here. So in January, this year, we promoted Sarah Armstrong to the role of Chief People Officer. Sarah has been with Rolls-Royce for more than 15 years, most recently as the leader of HR in our Civil Aerospace business, where she had a pivotal role in delivering that restructuring program, I talked about a moment ago.

11:16 And, in January, Rob Watson, President of Rolls-Royce Electrical, joined our executive team. Rob has been with us for 10 years. And over the last four years, he has played a fundamental role in the development of our Rolls-Royce Electrical business as we invest for more sustainable future. We have a strong capable and driven executive team. I'm very confident in their ability to deliver our vision for the future.

11:42 So, thank you and now over to Panos to talk about our financial performance.

Panos Kakoullis

11:47 Good morning, everybody and thank you, Warren. We are very proud of our achievements in 2021. Against a backdrop of challenging and unpredictable market conditions, we've delivered improved financial performance that's been driven by cost reduction and market growth. Results you can see on these slides with that all presented on an underlying basis and that's for the continuing businesses in the group.

12:12 Revenue, that stayed steady. So it's less than 2% lower than 2020 and we've seen a much more balanced contribution from across our businesses, with Civil Aerospace now contributing around 40% of the total. Lower wide-body volumes and lower shop visits in Civil Aerospace were balanced by growth in both Defence and Power Systems.

12:35 Operating profit was GBP414 million and that's a GBP2.5 billion improvement compared with 2020 and that reflects the significant cost savings from the restructuring program that was largely focused on Civil Aerospace. Defence performed well and more than covered it's increased R&D spend.

12:54 Power Systems, that grew strongly. It benefited from recovering end markets and better utilization on the shop floor. The underlying loss of GBP2 billion in the prior year were included GBP1.3 billion of one-off charges in Civil Aerospace and those were mostly related to the impact of COVID-19.

13:12 Free cash flow in 2021 that was an outflow of GBP1.5 billion, gain that was substantially improved on the prior year. We saw great progress on cost reduction, stronger operating performance that included higher flying hour receipts in Civil Aerospace and much more targeted capital expenditure.

13:30 The working capital outflow that you see GBP800 million, that was mostly driven by concession payments and lower OE deliveries in Civil Aerospace. You can look at the improvement on prior year and the prior year also included the non-repeat of GBP1.1 billion, the negative impact from the termination of invoice factoring in 2020. On the whole, a very substantial step in the right direction on our recovery journey.

13:58 We move on now to Civil Aerospace. The Civil Aerospace financial performance, again, significantly improved as we neared completion of our restructuring program. Gradual market recovery and the non-repeat of those COVID-related one-off charges from 2020 that also helped to enhance our financial performance. Overall, revenue was down 10% on prior year. If you break that down, OE revenues were down 29%, reflecting the reduction in engine deliveries as fewer large engines were required to fulfill customer build schedules, whilst sales of spare engines, well, they increased.

14:34 Business aviation OE deliveries were down as we transitioned to newer engine programs, which are now growing well from a low base. Services revenue was up 6% on the prior year and included GBP214 million of positive long-term service agreement catch-ups compared with a negative catch-ups of GBP1 billion in 2020. They also reflected lower shop visit volumes and a reduced contribution from the V2500 engine program. The underlying operating loss of GBP172 million was significantly better than the GBP2.5 billion loss in 2020. We continued to focus very heavily on those areas that are in our control and we're seeing sustainable cost benefits from that restructuring program.

15:22 Our trading cash outflow was GBP1.7 billion, again a substantial improvement from last year 2020. That was driven by engine flying hours. They were up 11% compared with 2020. In fact, second half engine flying hours were up 57% year-on-year as COVID vaccination programs, they enabled key routes to reopen although they are still at reduced volumes. Lower operating costs, lower CapEx and working capital outflows in 2021 as well as the non-repeat of that invoice factoring termination in 2020 also contributed to that improvement in cash flow.

16:00 If we turn now to Defence, our Defence business continued to perform well with strong demand for both OE and services driving growth in all of our end markets. That's combat, transport, submarines and naval. Underlying revenue, that increased by 5% on an organic basis to GBP3.4 billion with services revenue up 6% and OE revenue up 3%.

16:26 Underlying operating profit was GBP457 million, that's an increase of 3% compared with 2020. It's driven by sales growth and a positive mix towards higher margin spare parts and spare engine sales. That profit growth occurred despite a 28% increase in R&D spend. That was made to support our ongoing product development and the growth opportunities ahead of us.

16:53 Trading cash flow was GBP377 million, that gives a cash conversion of around 80%. That's a fairly normal level for our Defence business. The prior year, that trading cash flow, that included an adverse impact from the timing of deposit receipts. Finally, we have a strong order book in Defence that follows several years of high intake with a five-year average book-to-bill of 1.1 times and 85% order cover for 2022.

17:24 Moving on now to the Power Systems. Our end markets recovered well over the course of 2021. The order intake of GBP3.3 billion was 24% higher than the prior year with a much faster conversion seen to sales in that business than we would typically see in Defence and Civil Aerospace. Order growth was strongest in marine, defence and power generation. Underlying revenue of GBP2.7 billion was up 3%, services grew at 10% as product utilization increased, OE broadly flat.

17:59 Sales were higher in industrial and power generation, partly offset by lower activity in China. Underlying operating profit GBP242 million, up 37%. Operating margin was 8.8%, that's 2.2 percentage points higher than the prior year. That's due to the mix of sales towards higher margin aftermarket spare parts as well as improved utilization in our manufacturing facilities. We also experienced lower warranty costs. Trading cash flow, GBP219 million, representing a cash conversion of around 90%, despite an increase in inventory related to the global supply chain disruption we experienced in the second half of 2021.

18:46 We move on to New Markets and we've separated out our early stage businesses, those that got high growth potential, we put them into a distinct reporting segment, New Markets. This gives increased visibility to the investments we're making to address the new opportunities being created by the transition to net zero and the energy transition.

19:07 There are two businesses currently in this segment; Rolls-Royce SMR and Rolls-Royce Electrical. These businesses, well, they leverage our existing engineering expertise and capabilities to develop new sustainable products. Rolls-Royce SMR secured GBP490 million of funding in 2021, including GBP50 million we committed ourselves. We've already received around GBP30 million of that funding and the remaining cash inflow, that's going to be phased over the next few years to align with the underlying specific spend.

19:38 In 2021, a ramp-up in investment saw R&D costs of GBP68 million, GBP60 million of that in SMR, GBP52 million of that on electrical power and propulsion technology. Over the next five years, we anticipate spending over GBP1 billion in R&D in these businesses, although our cash spend will be considerably lower due to that third-party funding for SMRs.

20:04 New Markets they are naturally more challenging to forecast, given the pace of customer demand ramp up and also the regulatory approval process. What is clear though is the fact that the potential opportunities for these businesses are significant. We believe they could generate more than GBP5 billion of combined annual revenues by the early 2030s.

20:24 If we turn to the next slide, we set out here our summary funds flow. We saw a GBP1.5 billion cash outflow in the year from continuing operations, that's a significant improvement on the GBP4.2 billion outflow in 2020 and much better than our expectations that we set out at the start of 2021. If you break the movement down, you can break it broadly down into three buckets.

20:48 Firstly, we saw an operating performance improvement of around GBP2 billion, that was thanks largely to our cost savings in Civil Aerospace and also our revenue growth in both Defence and Power Systems. Secondly, our GBP800 million working capital outflow was GBP700 million better than 2020. That was mostly due to that non-repeat of the unwind of invoice factoring. That was partly offset by a planned increase in inventory in Defence and Power Systems to meet both expected sales volumes as we went into 2022 and the impact of global supply chain disruption in Power Systems.

21:26 And, thirdly, around about GBP100 million of the other impacts that reflected lower CapEx, partially offset by the higher hedge book closeout costs in the year. Our free cash flow is continuing to improve. The combination of restructuring and growth, driven by recovering end market, is putting us on track to get back to positive cash generation.

21:48 Turning now to our balance sheet on the next slide. We are committed to rebuilding our balance sheet and returning to an investment grade credit profile in the medium term. We're on the pathway to achieve this as we benefit from reducing uncertainty, improving financial performance and a strong strategic focus on the energy transition.

22:10 We previously announced four disposals which are expected to generate around GBP2 billion in total proceeds, including approximately GBP200 million of retained cash. The final and largest of these disposals, ITP Aero, is still expected to complete in the first half of this year, pending the necessary regulatory approvals.

22:32 Disposal proceeds together with the underlying free cash flow generated by the group will be used to reduce net debt. We ended the year GBP5.2 billion of net debt, including GBP1.8 billion of leases. Our liquidity position is strong, GBP7.1 billion of liquidity including GBP2.6 billion in cash at the end of 2021 and that is after we repaid during 2021, the 2021 EUR750 million bond and also the GBP300 million COVID Corporate Financing Facility. A strong balance sheet is very important for us. We will balance the pace of that rebuild with the investment opportunities across our portfolio to make sure that we maximize the long-term return for our shareholders.

23:21 Moving on to investments. Our technology and engineering expertise gives us a critical role in enabling the transition to a low-carbon global economy. We have significantly upgraded our approach to analyzing investment cases to place an even greater focus on sustainability and broader ESG considerations, whilst maintaining investment discipline.

23:46 Our investment spend is very much focused on making our existing products compatible with net zero, pioneering new technologies that can meet the accelerating demand for cleaner technologies, as well as identifying additional applications for our current portfolio of technologies. It is key that we optimize our investments in order to most effectively deliver our strategy, maximize our return and achieve our net zero commitments.

24:15 Our investments in both SMRs and electrical propulsion create net zero solutions and opportunities in new end markets. We have best-in-class products in markets with high barriers to entry and taking advantage of that, generating a healthy return on our investments, well, that's a priority for us.

24:34 Now we're seeing the 2021 financial performance. I just wanted to recap on the priorities that I set out to you all back in August. As a reminder, three priorities: deliver on our commitments, simplify how we report and invest wisely for the future. Firstly, delivering on our commitments. Right now, I feel very comfortable that we're making great strides. We've delivered the sustainable savings from our restructuring program and we continued to make sure that a large proportion of the costs have gone out, stay out, even as the load grows as demand grows.

25:11 We've exceeded our GBP2 billion free cash flow guidance for 2021 by over GBP500 million. And GBP300 million of that was due to concession slippages and we shared that with you in December and I'm not going to claim any credit for that, that's not controllable. The rest though, around GBP200 million, is due to our improved trading and cost performance and surpass the commitment despite engine flying hours being worse frankly than we expected when we set the guidance right at the start of 2021.

25:41 Secondly, we do need to simplify, breakdown the complexity around our financials. There is progress to be made in having more straightforward financial communications. I've taken some steps already to reduce the complexities, easier to understand disclosures, helping comparability between years and across peers. There is more to come during the course of 2022. I'm making sure that the changes we make align from their ground up with how we drive the businesses and reward performance.

26:14 And, thirdly, we will continue to invest wisely for the future, creating sustainable value. We are at a very exciting point, huge opportunity to lead our markets in the journey to net zero. We also have the opportunity to take our innovation and technology into New Markets with incremental growth and we won't stop investing in our current products either. There are good near term returns available from increasing durability and efficiency. So, as I said, three things; deliver on the commitments, simplify how we report and invest wisely.

26:49 If we move on to outlook, we are well positioned for the anticipated growth in our end markets. Despite some challenges around the pace of market recovery, global chain, supply chain disruption and rising inflation, I'm confident that we will see continued positive momentum in our financial performance. We expect low to mid-single digit revenue growth in 2022. That supported by a strong order book cover in both Defence and Power Systems and the continuation of a gradual improvement in Civil Aerospace along with an expected increase in spare engine sales.

27:24 We expect our operating profit margin to be broadly unchanged as underlying operational improvement is balanced with increased engineering spend to develop sustainable growth opportunities with a gradual shift in spend towards New Markets, Defence and Power Systems. We expect to generate modestly positive free cash flow in 2022, representing a substantial improvement on 2021.

27:53 Now that increase comes despite the concession slips that I mentioned earlier going from 2021 into 2022. As has been the case in prior years, cash flow will be seasonally weighted towards the second half of the year. Looking further ahead, long-term revenue growth will be driven by technology and innovation opportunities and rising global demand for sustainable power. This will be supported by well-targeted investment.

28:19 We aim to spend around 75% of our investment on lower carbon growth opportunities in the medium term. So a lot of opportunities ahead, a lots of growth from the energy transition, a lot of variables to manage and a much more agile and balanced business geared towards capturing that growth in a profitable and sustainable way.

28:39 And, with that, I'll hand back to Warren.

Warren East

28:42 Thank you, Panos. Now the title on this slide reflects the terminology that I used last month actually at our Annual Senior Leadership Conference, sustainable in both senses of the word, given our products and markets clearly sustainable in terms of climate and impact or not on the climate change, but my internal message was very much more focused on sustainability in the business sense, meaning generating profits and cash from our activities and seeking growth.

29:13 From a behavioral point of view, for our senior leaders, that means adopting a restless pursuit of ever greater levels of profit and return, holding our heads high, seeking out and capitalizing on growth opportunities, and I'd like to focus for the next few minutes on how we're driving growth and sustainable value in our established businesses; Civil Aerospace, Power Systems and Defence, before then moving on to the New Markets.

29:39 So I'll start with Civil. The fundamental restructuring program that we've delivered means that we now have much lower costs, much improved operational gearing. Now, we can see significant growth in demand in our factories and that's accompanied by only small incremental growth in our operating costs. This is extremely important as we continue to generate value from our large installed base, around two-thirds of our engines are covered by long-term service contracts that will deliver value way out into the future.

30:10 We also have more than half of the market share for new large engines with more than 1,500 on our order book. Our current order book includes 58 Trent XWB engines for Airbus's recently launched A350 freighter. The A350F represents a great opportunity for us to take share in a market that has been until recently dominated by Boeing and GE. We're also seeing fantastic growth opportunities in business aviation, where our family of Pearl engines is now offering market leading power and efficiency and outstanding low noise and emissions performance.

30:49 The slide here shows a picture from Dassault of their Falcon 10X. At the launch, we and Dassault revealed that they've chosen our Pearl 10X engine to exclusively power their brand new flagship aircraft. And Gulfstream have chosen our Pearl 700 to exclusively power their new ultra-long-range business jet, the G800, that's in addition to its use already announced on the G700. Pearl 700 testing is progressing very well and we're now in the final phase of regulatory approvals and we and Gulfstream are delighted with the results of the flight test program and we expect to receive certification later this year.

31:29 So, now, I'll move on to Defence. And we're seeing good growth opportunities in this business and that's critical to -- this business is critical to protecting people around the world. In 2021, we concluded a multi-year program of investment to revitalize our facilities in Indianapolis, creating a world-class campus with advanced manufacturing capabilities on a smaller and more efficient footprint and that's a very similar story really but on a smaller scale to the restructuring program that we just spoke about in Civil, baking in operational gearing which enhances the benefits of future growth.

32:07 And this was recognized last year as we secured the award for the highly competitive B-52 engine replacement program, generating $2.6 billion of business for the coming decades with entry into service towards the end of this decade. We intend to bring that operational gearing benefit to future growth as well as we pursue further design wins and we remain in a competitive process, for instance, for the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft program in the U.S. in partnership with Bell Textron.

32:37 And a win here would be a very significant driver for our long-term growth in Defence. Of course, back in the UK, we continue to work with our partners, the Ministry of Defence, BAE Systems, Leonardo, MBDA on the Tempest program with developments including the recently announced collaboration with Japan on our Power System demonstrator. We also continued to support the UK MOD in the collaboration announced last year between the UK, the U.S. and Australia on nuclear submarines.

33:10 Looking further ahead and Defence, of course, is a very long-cycle business. We are supporting customer demand for novel products that deliver advances in technology and sustainability. Investment opportunities include areas such as hypersonics, small engines and even power in space.

33:29 Now, we'll move on to Power Systems. We saw order intake accelerate in Power Systems with the business achieving the best ever order book in its history. We have a strong established position with our MTU brand engines and a loyal sticky customer base of over 40,000 customers. We're focused on supporting the transition to net zero and we've set some challenging targets to cut carbon dioxide emissions.

33:55 For many, that means deploying microgrid solutions like the one in the picture here with renewables, storage combined with back up from reciprocating engines and, of course, in future those reciprocating engines will be powered by synthetic fuels or hydrogen as we continue developing those technologies. In 2021, we formed a partnership with cellcentric to develop hydrogen fuel cells.

34:19 Following on from this, we've been awarded a significant contract to provide the first of a kind net zero microgrid, which will combine fuel cells and hydrogen combustion engines for the Port of Duisburg in Germany. And hold on to that thought for a moment, because I'll talk about airports in a little while.

34:40 Some of the strongest demand this year has been from data center customers. Our standby power solution was recently chosen by a hyperscale datacenter customer and as we expand our geographic reach and will grow market share in this space. Right. So that's our established businesses.

34:58 Now we will turn to what we call New Markets, our newly established reporting segment, including both Rolls-Royce SMR and Electrical. Whilst these businesses are at an early stage, as Panos explained, they come with huge growth potential focused on addressing the opportunities created by the transition to net zero.

35:18 Starting with the Rolls-Royce SMRs. We're using existing technology, which we've been taking to market for decades, over 60 years in fact in our nuclear submarine work. The diversification here is into New Markets with nuclear power plants for both on-grid and off-grid applications and we're seeing enormous amounts of support for this technology.

35:39 In 2021, we secured a sizable third-party funding through a UK government grant and equity investment from strategic and financial partners and this is helping us to fund our SMR design through the regulatory approval process and support us as we search for sites for those factories that will manufacture their first units.

35:59 First orders for the UK market are anticipated within the next couple of years. SMRs are a core part of the UK government's 10 point plan for a green industrial revolution. Our SMR is designed to deliver 417 megawatts of power on a size that is now a site -- rather that is only the size of two football pitches and that's very power dense.

36:20 They've been engineered for low cost and repeatable manufacturer, making them competitively priced with solar and wind, but without the associated intermittency challenges and costs and including all the costs of eventual decommissioning and waste management. What's also really exciting about SMRs is, how they can support our other businesses in the necessary production of green hydrogen and net zero synthetic fuels.

36:49 Then moving on to Electrical. In Rolls-Royce Electrical, we see again high growth potential. This is where we take a relatively new technology to a market sector that we know very well. Rolls-Royce has the mix of technologies and the skills that we've built through decades of sector specific knowledge and experience combined with market access and that's what makes us win.

37:16 With lots of people -- well, I mean, lots of people have the technical ability to work in electrical propulsion and power markets, we have Aerospace in our DNA and a track record of success. It's relatively easy to build electrical machines. They're all around us in many different shapes and sizes, typically low. Compared with the world of aviation, the power capabilities of these is relatively low.

37:38 To lift a heavy object into the sky and move it through the air for hundreds of miles needs much more power and the energy required has to be carried in that vehicle as well and that is getting into the realm of hard stuff; weight, thermal management, structural integrity, all very challenging, and extreme levels of safety and reliability too and it all becomes extremely difficult in a narrow application. But that's where the decades of experience and the depth of knowledge of Rolls-Royce makes the difference.

38:10 We are highly differentiated. We have the experience and the expertise and the safety track record to succeed and this is a growing market too. We partnered with Vertical Aerospace and we powered their VX4 all-electric urban air mobility vehicles. Vertical has $5.5 billion worth of pre-orders for over 100,000 rather of these products from some of the world's biggest and most innovative airlines. We're also strategically partnered with Embraer's urban air mobility spin-out, EVE.

38:47 By the end of last year, EVE had already secured over 1,700 of aircraft pre-orders with $5.2 billion and we have a collaboration with Tecnam and Wideroe announced at the half year for an all-electric powertrain for the commuter market and that's targeting entry into service in the mid-2020s.

39:07 Our Electrical business is not just for airborne solutions, we're combining our expertise in Electricals with our experience in Power Systems to develop a business opportunity for energy and charging infrastructure for airports and the vertiports in preparation for the advanced air mobility market. All-in-all, it's an extremely exciting time for our electricals business with many tangible opportunities in the pipeline.

39:35 So to summarize today's presentation and our full year results, we're proud to confirm that our financial performance is improving, thanks to both cost reduction and market growth. We are delivering on the commitments that we promised and we're investing to drive growth and deliver sustainable value into the future. Together, these make Rolls-Royce a better balanced and more sustainable business.

40:03 And, with that, we'll turn over to Q&A.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

40:21 [Operator Instructions]

Isabel Green

40:38 Hello. We've got a question on the website from Lavinia Sherwood, who asks how is restructuring helping to support the anticipated business ramp-up?

Warren East

40:47 Okay. Well, thank you very much. I will answer that a bit qualitatively. I mean, the restructuring is all about inserting operational gearing into the business, so that when activity increases, it delivers real value in terms of profit and we're confident that operational gearing will persist, because the costs will stay out and we can look at our Civil business and say it's 30% smaller in terms of footprint and in terms of head count. Now, those factories are not coming back. We have installed machines like I talked about in the presentation, which reduced cycle time hugely. We've changed our design processes, again reducing cycle time hugely, driving up the productivity. In fact with the reduced level of activity that we're still seeing in 2021, we have underutilized assets, but those assets will be utilized when the growth comes back and so the growth will be able to come back as we said with a relatively small increment in terms of operating costs. I don't know if there is anything to add to that really?

Panos Kakoullis

42:04 Yeah. I think, if I think about it from a quantitative perspective as we look to 2022, there is going to be a load increase in the Civil business. And seeing how that load increase manifest itself, so think around about 30% more load going through that business and when we look at it from an operating cash cost perspective, it's around about 6%. So it's a disproportionate increase in load supported by that gearing that Warren's referred to already. And if I just added a, I guess, a little bit of experience from having now spent quite a bit of time in the business and wandering around the shop floor and talking to our people and we've talked about it a little bit in the past around the mindset of our people, what would we be able to do now and what I'm able to do now is linking some of those individual activities that I see on the shop floor, how they are thinking, what they are thinking around quality, safety and efficiency and how that starts manifesting itself in lower costs going forward.

Warren East

43:02 Thank you.

Isabel Green

43:08 We're ready to take the next question, I think, from the phone lines, please.

Operator

43:17 Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Celine Fornaro from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Celine Fornaro

43:26 Thank you. It's Celine Fornaro. That was a nice one. Right. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one would be actually on providing slightly more color, if you could, on the cash Aerospace and the trading cash performance there and the dynamics that are underlying, I would say, as you highlighted on the introductory remarks and are they likely to stay 2022 and 2023 and what I'm thinking here or interested in is, if you assume some sort of a pickup in the shop visit, how do you think your estimated cost in the shop visits are trending compared to the real cash cost that you are incurring and that's true for A350, 787 and A330? And my second question is on the GBP1 billion of cash savings that you have achieved, excluding CapEx, how should we think about the return of these costs looking at ‘22 and ‘23, please? Thank you.

Warren East

44:44 Okay. Celine, I'll -- thanks for the question. Kicking off, more color on that cash. I mean, clearly cash incoming depends on the rate of recovery of activity in the markets. We do anticipate the steep increase in activity, which we saw second half on second half in the ‘21 numbers to continue, albeit at a slightly sort of slow rate, because you're building on a larger base as we go through ‘22. So consensus forecast would be for approximately a 50% increase in flying hours. Now, you can see when we think about shop visits and our planned number of shop visits to deal with that, you can see from the answer that Panos gave a moment or two ago, we're anticipating roughly a 30% increase in load on our factories and that's really driven by the component demand from those shop visits.

45:44 And the cost of the shop visits is clearly related to the cost reductions that we talked about a moment ago and that sort of takes us into the second half of your question on the GBP1 billion and I'd sort of bring you back to Panos's answer a moment ago, where we've sort of divorcing the load increase from the operational cost increase. You're probably going to go on and ask us about material cost increases and supply chain challenges and all those sorts of things as well. And, of course, those are baked in, but I'd remind people of the long-term nature of this business, the long-term nature of the contracts that we have with suppliers in the escalation clauses that we have in there.

Celine Fornaro

46:38 Thank you.

Operator

46:44 So your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Robert Stallard

46:52 Yeah. Thanks so much. Good morning. And this is probably a question for Panos. You highlighted the GBP300 million positive benefit from concessions in ‘21 and it's a slight sensitive topic, but what are your expectations for concession payments looking into the 2022 numbers and potentially for 2023 as Boeing eventually restarts deliveries on the 787?

Panos Kakoullis

47:18 Thanks, Robert. Yeah. That's probably hard to predict, because it does depend on some regulatory outcomes, the assumption we made is that GBP300 million slipped into ‘22 as you have seen and we do expect to see some unwind as we go through -- overall through the course of the year. It's going to typically depend on deliveries, overall deliveries of new engines this year, we're expecting to be flat. But I'm saying that, going into 2022, it could potentially slip a little bit into ‘23. We will highlight it for you as and when we have a greater clarity on it and it's something we pull out and you heard me talk about it earlier on in the presentation, it's an uncontrollable. So I'm not going to claim credit for it if it doesn't happen and if it happens earlier, then we'll highlight it.

Robert Stallard

48:12 Yeah. And as a quick follow-up, I'm sorry, I'm hearing myself, sorry. And then maybe a question for Warren. On the fantastically named Vertical Aerospace, I was wondering what your thoughts are on potentially monetizing that stake at some point in the future or is this a long-term investment?

Warren East

48:33 Goodness me, this is as far as we're concerned a long-term investment. It's sort of cementing a partnership as it were. We are looking at that whole space and, as I say, huge growth opportunity. There are uncertainties around that. The market really doesn't exist today and so there is a bigger on what that market is going to look like in, say, 2030. We're very confident when we look at our partners though that we're looking for a balance of partners like Vertical Aerospace, which are -- which a new companies tackling this market and companies like EVE, the spin-out from Embraer where you have a more established player, we're interested in powering as many of them as possible, because as I've just talked about a moment or two ago, we think we have a real differentiation there. And as far as investments are concerned, we're not making a habit of investing in everybody. But where we can do a little bit of catalyzing, then we will.

Robert Stallard

49:45 That's very helpful. Thank you.

Operator

49:51 So your next question comes from the line of George Zhao from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

George Zhao

49:58 Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. I guess, first question, can you just talk more about the increased investments in ‘22 driving the flat margins for this year? How much higher and how much of that is going to the New Markets? And I guess second question is more on the New Markets. I mean you decided to give the GBP5 billion revenue outlook by the early 2030, I guess why would now the time to give this figure when we're clearly very much at the infancy stage for these new ventures and now that you've given us this GBP5 billion number, could you give us some details on how will you get there and what are some of the investments requirements over the medium term to succeed here?

Warren East

50:38 Okay. I'm going to ask Panos to talk about the ‘22 investments and I'll come back and add some color on the new businesses that we talked about this morning.

Panos Kakoullis

50:48 Thanks, George. So -- and you'll have picked it up from both the release and how we presented, there is a sort of a pivot away into some of those growth opportunities over the course of the next few years, probably a little bit away from Civil and where the Civil business is. And the increase of the investment, you can -- you better see them effectively in three places. So Defence, where we've got some big bits coming up and we're in that stage of ramping up around those bits now. Power Systems in particular, because that's -- you heard us talk about energy transition, that is where the big opportunities are sitting right in front of us at the moment. We've got 40,000 very, very sticky loyal customers, who are coming to us now increasingly.

51:36 In fact, we had a Board Meeting earlier this week when we were looking at the ramp up of that order book around that. So the investments there around the technologies and the system solutions to help those customers that you see coming through that and as you've rightly said around New Markets and we're very deliberately, for this year, trying to give you more clarity. We've pulled out those New Markets businesses into that segment, both SMR and Electrical and we pulled out to show you how much R&D. Now that -- the ramp -- there is a big element of that ramp-up does happen in ‘22 in those New Markets.

52:09 So -- and I think we've used sort of the word substantial, so you can think about that as a sort of near doubling of investment in that. That doesn't all come through in terms of cash. There will definitely be a P&L, because those are businesses that we control and consolidate. But you saw from an SMR perspective how much of that is coming from both government funding and third-party shareholders. And as you go forward that cash profile, particularly on SMR, is matched by customer orders and deposits coming in and matches off on that on how that spend happens. And I think we've talked about what we expect the rough spend over the next five years to be on New Markets is around about GBP1 billion mark, which about half of it and we will fund ourselves.

Warren East

52:58 Yeah. And I think Panos has sort of answered really the second part of the question there as well. We're talking about a GBP1 billion of investment and we pulled it out because we want to demonstrate that this is investment, not just sort of central R&D costs. Clearly, if we're imagining -- I imagine it was a completely standalone start-up business, you have to paint to your investors a picture of the sort of return that you're going to make and that's why we're talking about GBP5 billion in the early ‘30s now. Clearly, as I said, in answering to a question a moment ago, there is uncertainty around here. We're expecting these Electrical Aviation products to enter into service around about the middle of the decade, maybe between the middle of the decade and the next couple of years after that the SMRs we've talked about having orders in the next couple of years with revenue recognized in proportion to costs, but we're talking about getting these on the grid around about the end of the decade, maybe 2030 a little bit beyond.

54:13 So there is uncertainty in it, but we're trying to paint a picture just to sort of scope out roughly the sort of size of contribution that is being made by those businesses in that time frame. It is very, very approximate. I would just highlight that Panos referred to the investment that we're making in Power Systems, however. This is an established business with existing customers, with much shorter development cycles, and so we absolutely expect to see a revenue impact from the net zero investments in Power Systems well before the second half of this decade.

George Zhao

55:00 All right. Thank you.

Operator

55:04 So your next question comes from the line of Ben Heelan from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Ben Heelan

55:12 Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And I had a couple of questions around the guidance. I was quite surprised to see the low to mid-single digit revenue guide at the group level. And is there any divisional breakdown that you can give us around that? And then, secondly, on the margin, you've talked about the operating margin being flat. Is there any color you can give around gross margin? Obviously, you've said R&D investments are growing, so how should we think about the gross margin progress as we go through this year? Thank you.

Panos Kakoullis

55:44 You would have seen we've done something different in how we talk about guidance going forward and that was a very deliberate reflection on the shape of the business that we have now and it's a very different business to the one we had two years ago. It's a much more balanced. You heard Warren talked about much more balanced and sustainable business. So 40% of it is Civil Aerospace, 60%, the majority now is Defence and Power Systems. So when we thought about guidance and you've heard me talk about a much more balanced view of the KPIs that we think about, so that's why we've talked about revenue growth, that's why we talked about margin in addition to what we've traditionally talked about around cash and in due course as with that track record builds, we start thinking about what's the return that we can start demonstrating on that. From a revenue perspective that low to mid, how does that pan out across the businesses.

56:40 So you've seen very strong order book, I think Warren referred to record order book in Power Systems, that turns into revenue over the course of this year. So you can see good growth coming through in the Power Systems business. The Defence business is a steady business. The big wins that we've talked about, they take time to come through, I think Warren talked about. That secures decades effectively of -- for -- into the future. That doesn't come through immediately. So think of that as -- that's modest in terms of revenue and then that leaves you effectively with Civil Aerospace, which again is modest growth and that's primarily determined by what happens around activity driving increased shop visits. You will have seen in the release some of the factors that start affecting that. We had some long-term service agreements catch-ups, which went through revenue this year. So that's a factor that you have to think about from a headwind perspective on revenue.

57:43 And then as you look at those in terms of margin, if I go through sort of three businesses, the Defence business, we had a good mix around margin this year, just gone 2021, around spare parts and spare engines. Those are typically higher margin. We get back to a more normal level of mix next year. So that has an impact on your gross margin. Similarly, when we think about Power Systems, again there was quite a high element of service rather than OE. That tends to be a little bit higher margin as well. So that's how that changes. And then from a Civil Aerospace perspective, the margin mix of the business going forward is definitely changing. We are into the newer engine programs. Those are the programs that are flying more frequently now than they were in the past. They are at earlier stage. We've recognized less margin on those as they are less mature. There is a little bit of margin left to come.

58:39 And when I look at the balance sheet and I look at that long-term service agreement balance, that creditor that sits there, that is -- there are big chunks of that that are potential margin as we work our way through, as Warren has talked about, how those cost savings come through, how we increased time on wing, that has a direct impact on margin as we go into the future.

Ben Heelan

59:03 Okay, great. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up, because I told earlier, in the call, you talked about expecting a roughly 30% increase in load for shop visits. So how do I tie the 30% increase in load to the kind of modest growth in Civil Aerospace's? How significant is that revenue headwind from the catch-ups?

Panos Kakoullis

59:24 So, Ben, the load was across the whole of the Civil business, including business aviation. So there's quite a big ramp-up in OE for business aviation as we go through this year. So it's OE ramp up in business aviation and an increase in shop visits across the board. So that's how I think about it.

Ben Heelan

59:43 Okay. Very clear. Thank you.

Warren East

59:45 Thank you.

Operator

59:50 So your next question comes from the line of Harry Breach from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Harry Breach

59:57 Hi. Yes. Hello, Warren and Panos. Can you hear me?

Warren East

60:00 We can.

Harry Breach

60:02 Great. Yes. Thank you for the question. And forgive me, because I missed the first half hour of this. Can I just -- first of all, can I just ask about time and material last year. I think sort of in the -- in the sort of first half of this year, T&M was about 16% of overall underlying revenue for Civil Aero. And can you -- and I might have missed this, so please forgive my ignorance. Can you give us a sense of where it was for full year 2021 and how you might see that trending in 2022, if you can? And then just thinking about major shop visits, I think in the presentation you kindly gave us the number for Civil last year, what should we be expecting compared with that 208 base in 2021? What should we expecting for this year and going forward? I guess, because there is some discretion in the scheduling of those, I appreciate long-term trend will match EFH, but there may be some scheduling discretion, so any help would be greatly appreciated?

Panos Kakoullis

61:10 Yeah. So on -- we didn't talk about time and material, so you didn't miss that bit. Second half, first half, think about that as roughly the same, so there wasn't a significant disconnect between the two. In terms of shop visits, you are very right, it is driven by actual flying activity and Warren referred to what the market is anticipating around the increase in engine flying hours. There is always a little bit of a lag in terms of how that comes through, but expect shop visits to go up, probably a little bit less than flying hour activity given that lag that is typically there.

Harry Breach

61:56 Great. Thank you. Thank you, both.

Operator

62:02 So your next question comes from the line of David Perry from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

David Perry

62:12 Yes. Thank you, gentlemen for taking the call. I'm sorry, I missed a fair amount of the speeches, so I apologize if I'm asking something you've covered. I've got two questions and both for you, I think, Panos. One is high level and one is more detailed. High level, you said you want to simplify how we report. I look at H1 2021 where you delivered a massive bit in Civil Aero EBIT, I look at H2, the full year where there is a huge miss and guidance way below consensus. I think none of them -- I'm sorry -- have a clear, frankly, what is it that you can change that makes this somehow more predictable and that more investable and so it's quite a high-level question? The much more detailed one is, you've clearly guided to an EBIT number well below the sell-side consensus. Can you just walk me from this EBIT number to the cash flow in 2022? So what are you assuming out for working capital? What are you assuming on the LTSA guide, that would be very helpful? Thank you.

Panos Kakoullis

63:23 Sure. So let me take that up. So I think as we said at the half year and you and I've had some good discussions, David, around simplification. When I look at how we simplify the way we communicate, the way we report, as you said, the way we help you understand the business and make it more investable, I think, what we've done for this full year, we have started to give you some more clarity, so we've shown trading cash flow by business, which is something we have done before. We pulled out what we're doing on the investments within the New Markets, again to give some clarity on that. And frankly started to use a little bit of nomenclature that is more common, so I want to be have comparability, I think, across years and between peers. And when I look at what our peer group do, I want to be -- us to be aspiring to that. There is still more to go and you may have missed it when I was talking about it earlier on. This needs to be done ground up. I'm not going to put something over the top for sort of veneer and how I present, because it's fundamental to how we run the business on a day-to-day basis, making sure that the underlying value drivers that Warren and I spend time within the business as we push on those and as we start showing you what those value drivers are and how we think about them, how they link up to the outside performance, and when you do that budgeting remuneration, how people get rewarded, the whole thing has to work in a robust way.

64:59 So things still to come, things that will help what you've asked for are what we do around foreign exchange and our hedging policy, which is different to what others do and that will take time to put in place. And particularly the last point you made there effectively is around contract accounting and having a much tighter link between what happens in the underlying contracts and how that shows up from a profit and cash perspective, you will never get a direct link between cash and profit in an any long-term contracting business. But how that trend can be much more easily seen. So that we've done some and there is more to go.

65:48 In terms of your -- effectively your comment on profit, we've never really given guidance around profit in the past. It's been -- it was my observation when I came in, because it was a predominantly Civil Aerospace driven business. There was a lot of focus around cash. It's a different trade business there. It is a much more balance sheet business and that's why we started talking about revenue, that's why we started talking about margin as well as cash and to come how we think about returns. So that's why that profit is there. I don't view it as missing guidance, I view it as helping you think about guidance and consensus going forward, because it's nothing we've really talked about in the past and that's been very evident when I look at the range of profit the analyst community have in the past, it's never really been talked about. Now we want to put it in a much more understandable way. In terms of the big movements around cash and how profitability comes back, let me come back to that in a few minutes. It is a detailed question. If we take the next one and I'll come back to you.

David Perry

67:06 Okay.

Operator

67:24 So your next question comes from the line of Andrew Humphrey from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Andrew Humphrey

67:31 Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Maybe a couple of bigger picture questions. Warren, we talked a lot today about opportunities for the business and kind of more balanced portfolio going forward. Could you maybe talk about how you would view the biggest challenges for your successor? And there is another kind of broader question. Where does the departure of Warren put us in terms of any potential midterm target setting that we might see this year? And then I also wanted to ask a bit about Power Systems. Clearly, we've had a very strong performance there on orders. Clearly that is also a shorter cycle business than the Civil Aero. So I wanted to ask about what additional challenges there may be in terms of supply chain management and protection around the margins that business is making over the next couple of years? Thank you.

Warren East

68:35 Okay. Well, I'll go with those, Andrew. Thanks very much. So I think the challenges over the next several years, the strategy is very clear. The challenge is, there is a lot of opportunity out there and it's making the investment calls and balancing that investment alongside looking after our existing business. So we talk about value creation from our installed fleet, for instance, in Civil Aerospace by extending their time on wing. That takes engineering effort, resource investment and so on, but so do the opportunities in net zero that we talked about both within Power Systems, actually within things like Electrical Aviation and even in Defence addressing net zero opportunities. So the challenges are those. And we included a slide in Panos's presentation that Panos presented around how we think about investments and deploying capital and I think therein lies the biggest challenges over the next several years.

69:52 As for target setting, medium-term target setting and so on, we will come to that. When we talked about my moving on this morning, that is the end of this year and so I'm -- after we do this results presentation, I'm back to running the business and any target setting that we do around the middle of this year will be no change. Supply chain challenges, particularly in Power Systems, we do expect the supply chain challenges that we've seen over the second half of 2021 persisting through quite a bit of 2022. Right now, if we compare what we anticipate those challenges to -- the impact that they might have on a sort of otherwise budget, think high tens of millions of pounds up towards GBP100 million as an impact for 2022. So if miraculously we're able to deal with those supply chain challenges and they go away, then there is some potential upside there. But we're not hugely optimistic about that happening anytime soon.

Panos Kakoullis

71:17 Let me just come back here.

Andrew Humphrey

71:17 Okay. Thank you.

Panos Kakoullis

71:18 Let me just come back to David's point, sort of reflected on it. So -- and I think, David, you asked the sort of the detailed point around the bridge between operating profit and free cash flow and what's sort of driving that? It's going to be a number of things going that way. We're going to get to a more normal pattern of working capital within the business as engine flying hours start to increase and we've talked about what that ramp up would look like, offset a little bit by the shop visits, but those tend to lag. There is some increased investment spend that we talked about, both in the CapEx and in R&D perspective going against that. There is the continuation of the hedge unwind costs, that's going to be a little bit lower than we saw this year. Most of the other factors stay the same. So that's typically what you'll see going through. At a macro level, if you just look one numbers and the other, the bridge isn't trying to bridge very much, but there are lots of ins and outs to get you from one to the other.

Operator

72:34 So your next question comes from the line of Charles Armitage from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Charles Armitage

72:43 Thank you. A couple of questions. I think David is doing a bit better than I am. I'm struggling to get today to Ben's question. Low to mid-single digit sales growth. So we've got a 30% increase in load in Aerospace in profit recognition and revenue recognition along with work done. We've got GBP3.3 billion inflow in Power Systems versus GBP2.7 billion of sales in orders and that converts pretty quickly. We've got Defence stable and we got a negative GBP200 million -- headwind of GBP200 million from CSA cap shops. I'm struggling to get down to low to mid-single digit growth given lots of growth in Power Systems and seemingly Civil Aerospace, what am I missing?

Panos Kakoullis

73:39 So, Charles, that was on the revenue side?

Charles Armitage

73:41 Yes.

Panos Kakoullis

73:42 Yeah. So, I think, on Civil we said, when answered earlier on, I said modest growth in Civil, because that's determined by shop visits coming through and the recognition of revenue around those shop visits, they typically lag as we've said around what's happening on engine flying hours. And on Defence, we said broadly stable. There is a little bit up and there is good growth within Power Systems. When you take all of that mixed together, that's how you end up with low to mid.

Charles Armitage

74:17 Okay. I believe, I think pretty hard on that. Next question. On SMR, what do you need to have -- what -- effectively what level do you need to have carbon cost to make, to be able to be viable for SAF production? Alternatively, what can you produce the SAF at?

Warren East

74:50 Yeah. I'll have a go at answering that, but I can't answer it explicitly to be honest. I mean, what we do know is that SAF requires a huge amount of energy and the electrification of multiple sectors is putting a huge amount of demand on traditional generation. SAF is a sort of large increment on top of that. You have to use energy to create the hydrogen, you then have to use energy to combine that hydrogen, you have to use energy to capture carbon dioxide as well and then put it together. So the rationale is that, it's a zero carbon effective way. We know that the levelized cost of electricity is comparable with wind. We know that that includes the cost of decommissioning and waste management and that the cost of wind and solar and the like doesn't include the cost of storage required to offset the intermittency. So I can't give you an answer in terms of carbon price, but I can give you an answer in terms of the large amount of demand which is there and the comparable competitive cost of electricity. And then you get into the sizing and the logistics of arranging for large amounts of powerful things like SAF plants and significant hydrogen generation plants and the infrastructure that has to be put around it and that's the economic argument for an off-grid application.

Charles Armitage

76:35 That helps completely about that one. Thank you.

Operator

76:43 I'll now hand back to Isabel for question from the webcast.

Isabel Green

76:47 Thank you. And there's actually quite a lot of questions on the webcast and we're not going to get through them all today and in fact quite a few of them, I think, have been covered by the answers given. But, just to say, if anybody feels that they need a direct answer, do come back to the Investor Relations team. So the last question is actually from someone on the buy-side. We have Tim Ashton. Who -- Warren, he is asking you how much do you think Rolls-Royce has changed in your tenure? I'm going to add in a, so far on that, because I know that you're not finished yet.

Warren East

77:13 No, I'm certainly not finished yet. Yeah. It's a difficult question and it's hard to quantify it exactly. I mean, what I said this morning was that, if I compare the company, I walked into with the company we have now, it still contiguous. From a cultural and behavioral point of view, it's a very different business. Some of the messaging I hope we've got across this morning is that, from an operational point of view, it's also a very different business with strong operational gearing baked in. So that as we lean towards growth in the future, that growth will have a big contribution to real value creation. So, I think, it is fit for the future. I think, two, we have a very clear strategic direction and it's very much a broad based power group that we look at now and that gives us a much bigger opportunity set. The future of this business is not dependent on long range long-haul aviation, so that's a sort of summary, but it's probably time for a longer discussion rather than an answer in a Q&A like this.

78:40 I'd also highlight a huge difference in the people by the way just before finishing on that. We have a much smaller organization, but if I look at things like the senior leadership group here, it's about 60% smaller, it's between 5 and 10 years younger, and I think these are some of the intangible things which make a massive difference to the agility and the ability of the business to be competitive going forwards.

79:11 Thank you. I think, Isabel is busy telling me that that is the last question. So, thanks everybody for joining. We do appreciate that you've had a very busy day today even before events that happened in Ukraine. The messages we'd like you to take away: improving financial performance in our results evident here; the operational gearing that we've talked about, we are delivering on our commitments; and we're very focused on the future both in terms of the opportunities for growth in our established businesses and in the new businesses and we look forward to seeing you with an update on progress when we give you an update at the half year. Thank you."

Car tax changes to launch in months despite drivers concerns

Massive number plate changes to come into effect next month

The air taxi is an example of an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft which is set to become more common in the future.

The unmanned flight took place at their flight test area in Jiangsu province in China in January 2022.

When ready for commercial flight in 2025, it is expected that a trip that takes hours by car will be reduced to about 10 minutes with Prosperity I, without being any less safe or more expensive than a taxi ride.

Vertical flight for the proof of concept for Prosperity I required eight rotors to lift the 1,500kg, state-of-the-art electric aircraft into the air.

In 2011, renowned US tech entrepreneur and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen published an essay entitled “Why Software is Eating the World,” arguing that value would shift away from traditional industries to providers of software and software-enabled services and products.

It was a prescient thesis. In the past decade, the software sector has grown at twice the rate of the aggregate of all industries —a disparity only reinforced by the rapid acceleration in digital behaviors the COVID-19 pandemic has fueled. While the global economy shrank by 3.3 percent in 2020 compared with 2019, revenue in the software industry grew by 2.7 percent and is expected to grow at more than twice the rate of world GDP over the next five years.

What Andreessen did not assess, however, was how software might also eat away at the strength of certain parts of the global economy, such as Europe, for instance. By September 2021, seven of the ten most valuable companies in the world were software or software-enabled companies, reflecting the sector’s growing economic importance. And the year before, well over a third of the 100 most valuable companies in the United States came from the sector, as did about a quarter of those in Asia. In Europe, however, that figure stood at just 7 percent (exhibit). Today, not a single European company features on the list of the world’s ten most valuable software and software-enabled companies, and there are just three among the top 20.

Those kinds of large companies can have a potentially disproportionate impact on a region’s economic competitiveness. The winner-takes-all dynamic prevalent in the software sector dictates that larger players enjoy significant advantages, creating powerful ecosystems that attract more partners and customers. And because software is largely a fixed-cost business, the margins they enjoy as they expand can be used to fund further innovation and expansion—including the purchase of smaller players globally. Hence, unless start-ups grow rapidly and become leaders themselves, they are likely to be acquired or outcompeted by industry giants.

Building more market-leading software and software-enabled companies is thus critical to Europe’s future in the sector and for its overall economic competitiveness and vibrancy. But how can this be accomplished? To identify solutions, we spoke with more than 20 key participants in the software industry, including CEOs who were leading or had led software companies in Europe and in the United States, investors, software experts, leaders of industry associations, and public-sector representatives.

European software solutions

Some solutions proffered by the interviewees were familiar, namely, calls for government assistance to help overcome barriers caused by Europe’s market fragmentation, labor policies, and certain regulations. They address the same barriers often cited as impediments to the development of AI, digitalization, and start-ups in Europe, and range from more actively promoting technical fields of study in universities to providing fiscal and capital incentives for investors and streamlining and harmonizing regulations.

The interviewees further asserted, however, that the private sector—software companies, companies that use software, and investors—has a big role to play.

One common message was the need for a cultural shift. There was a perception that European investors and entrepreneurs had lower growth ambitions and, not surprisingly, a lower appetite for risk. Some interviewees felt Europeans’ discomfort with the risks associated with growth was partly responsible for what they see as a focus on short-term profit rather than value creation in the medium and long term. “European entrepreneurs tend to be conservative. They are often more willing to cash out than their American counterparts,” was the perception of one interviewee. “In consolidation scenarios, European companies often prefer to be the seller rather than buyer,” another commented.

Sidebar European software executive perspectives Opportunities “Combining software expertise with the domain expertise of Europe’s strong industrial and engineering base opens the door for innovative collaboration, which is a huge differentiator in my opinion. If we can make Europe’s traditional industries truly connected and their products software-driven, then I believe we will see more global leaders in Europe.”

–Sanjay Brahmawar, CEO, Software AG “Europe’s time zone facilitates operating a global business, and flight options are good too. We can conduct morning meetings with Asia and afternoon meetings with the Americas, all during normal working hours.”

–Rashmy Chatterjee, CEO, Istari “Starting up in a small country has forced us to go international and learn to operate across multiple markets very quickly.”

–Silvio Kutić, CEO and cofounder, Infobip Challenges “We don’t have to look at Silicon Valley as the only model of success. European software companies need to be bold and build on their unique strengths to compete globally.”

–Sanjay Brahmawar, CEO, Software AG “We see a shortage of IT and AI skills in the market. Solving that problem will require more investment in recruiting, retaining, and developing the best people, and a commitment to evolve corporate cultures and make them more agile, innovative, and attractive to top tech talent.”

–Sanjay Brahmawar, CEO, Software AG “From a cultural point of view, I sometimes feel that the energy level is lower than what I’ve experienced in New York and Silicon Valley. There’s sometimes a lower level of ambition that doesn’t encourage as much entrepreneurship. There’s less acceptance of failure too perhaps.”

–Rashmy Chatterjee, CEO, Istari “In my view, Europe needs more diversity—not just of gender but diversity of background and points of view. The business climate in Europe is respectful and friendly, but innovators seemed to have followed a similar, defined trajectory. Enabling wider participation to new groups, who think differently and have different backgrounds, could result in bolder, game-changing ideas that have global impact.”

–Rashmy Chatterjee, CEO, Istari “It starts with education. We have great universities, but we do not always focus quickly enough on developing the core skills required for the future. We need to teach students how to work better in multidisciplinary teams, rather than in silos.”

–Silvio Kutić, CEO and cofounder, Infobip “We need to encourage more risk taking. Americans are often willing to take risks to grow fast. I think European entrepreneurs need to resist the urge to sell too quickly, often leaving a lot of the upside for the acquirers.”

–Silvio Kutić, CEO and cofounder, Infobip

On a broader scale, the interviewees proposed an overarching strategic shift to help European companies succeed in the software industry. They encouraged the sector to focus on areas where Europe could leapfrog ahead by playing to its strengths, rather than trying to play catch-up in areas already dominated by others. “A strategy that entails copying the greatest US hits may, in some cases, have provided solid returns, but it is certainly not a formula for building software giants,” said one interviewee. At the same time, on a more practical level, the interviewees noted the importance of embracing state-of-the-art operating practices to help new companies scale rapidly and overcome the inherent disadvantages of a fragmented market (See sidebar, “European software executive perspectives,” for more views).

Our interviews and research point to three areas where Europe could take a lead and build large players by playing to the continent’s strengths: vertical B2B software, software platforms for digitizing small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), and horizontal platforms built on European R&D excellence.

Vertical B2B software

The annual global market for vertical software, which powers industry-specific processes, currently stands at around $100 billion and is expected to grow at an annual rate of some 19 percent over the next five years. That level of growth not only exceeds that of more general functional or horizontal software but would be strong enough to support existing software companies as well as a number of new, global champions.

Many of the largest B2B software companies have already made moves to establish themselves in the space. Salesforce has acquired Vlocity, a start-up with industry-specific solutions; Oracle has made multiple acquisitions of software companies that serve industries such as construction, communications, retail, and hospitality and travel; and SAP, Europe’s largest software company, has launched an industry cloud to provide solutions for many verticals. Notwithstanding, the field still remains relatively open, and Europe has grounds on which to build leadership.

It is important to note that Europe already has a strong position in a number of industry verticals such as automotive, construction, pharmaceuticals, and travel, giving would-be European software giants valuable access to target customers in order to understand their businesses and emerging needs and develop close working relationships.

Software companies could then choose to build and scale their own solutions or consolidate assets with other software companies to build scale. They could even join forces with companies in the target industries to create new solutions. And large industrial companies could leverage their own software assets by treating them as truly separate businesses. On these last two points, Europe has a strong track record with two of the three most valuable software companies in the continent (Dassault Systèmes and Amadeus) emerging from the initiative of the vertical industries involved.

Amadeus, a global airline reservations system, was formed in 1987 in a collaboration between Air France, Iberia, Lufthansa, and SAS. It has since grown to become a world leader in this segment, expanding to provide software for airlines, hotels, and airports and establishing itself as one of Europe’s largest and most valuable software companies.

Dassault Systèmes has carried off a similar feat in aerospace and heavy engineering. It was created in 1981 when Dassault Aviation spun off its software division in a strategic partnership with IBM, aiming to commercialize its computer-aided aircraft design software. Today, the company is the second most valuable software company in Europe and is recognized as a global leader in software for 3-D product design, simulation, manufacturing, and more. Recently, it expanded into pharmaceuticals, providing software for drug development and the development of COVID-19 vaccines.

Cross-border platforms for SMEs

SMEs—small to medium-size enterprises with fewer than 250 employees—dominate the European Union’s economy, accounting for more than 50 percent of GDP and 65 percent of employment. In the United States, the figures are around ten to 15 percentage points lower. Despite that prominence, European SMEs have been slow to digitize, and large B2B software companies tend to not serve the sector, regarding it as a niche market in which local companies can compete more effectively. Nevertheless, European SMEs have been significant spenders in technology, with companies with fewer than 1,000 employees spending more than $30 billion a year on software alone (nearly half of which is spent on vertical- or industry-specific software).

That demand is likely to grow as the COVID-19 crisis has prompted SMEs, like larger organizations, to recognize the importance of digitization if they are to buy, sell, and collaborate remotely. Aspiring software champions have the opportunity to meet that demand and grow it further by building large SME platforms that span Europe and beyond and offer newer, more advanced solutions such as predictive AI or Internet of Things (IoT).

The largest software companies currently exploring this seemingly fertile ground are not European—Intuit being an example. And even Stripe, a software-enabled payments company now dual headquartered in the United States and Ireland, was started by its Irish founders in California. Notwithstanding, a crop of new European companies are emerging in areas from financial management to process automation. Amsterdam-based fintech unicorn Mollie, a payments services provider, is one such player.

Horizontal platforms built on European R&D excellence

European private investment in R&D lags well behind that in other regions—1.4 percent of GDP compared with 2.2 percent in the United States and 1.7 percent in China. Some interviewees noted that this was consistent with what they see as the short-term focus and moderate growth ambitions of European companies and investors. Others felt that European companies lacked confidence in their ability to innovate.

In contrast, Europe performs well when it comes to R&D in the public and educational sectors, spending 0.7 percent of GDP compared with 0.5 percent spending in China and 0.8 percent in the United States. This is reflected in its academic record: Europe is home to 16 of the top 50 global life-science universities and is recognized as a world leader in some spheres, such as cell and gene therapy (CGT) research. Between 2017 and 2019, it published some 120,000 CGT research papers whose lead authors were affiliated with a European institution. Equivalent figures for US and Chinese papers were 72,000 and 100,000, respectively.

The interviewees felt that investors and companies could work more closely with European research universities and institutions to translate this kind of basic research into economic value and market leadership. In doing so, they could emulate the model used in technology hubs in Silicon Valley, Boston, Austin, or North Carolina’s Research Triangle, where local companies cofund many projects with top educational institutions, and investors are quick to identify new ideas and talent from those institutions to help create new companies and innovative products and services.

Similar hubs are being built in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, and Paris, and there is a “golden triangle” in England with strong ties to top-tier UK universities based in Cambridge, London, and Oxford. This hub kick-started the lion’s share of the United Kingdom’s approximately 100 unicorns and attracted venture capital worth $15 billion in 2020. Notwithstanding, our interviewees believe that Europe’s academic strength is not being used to its full advantage. They felt that government promotion of hubs could help, but companies and investors are ultimately those that must forge the links.

European companies can also help shape the agendas of academic and research institutions, as these are not always aligned with future economic priorities. For example, as of October 2021, Europe’s share of patents granted in three high-potential technology areas—edge computing, computer vision, and blockchain—stood between 9 and 11 percent. The US share was 72 to 88 percent and Asia’s 8 to 19 percent.

Operational and management best practices

European companies seeking to become big players would need to think about how to adopt the software industry’s operational and management best practices in order to overcome the challenge of a fragmented European market. They will also likely need to build scale—fast. Two practices stand out.

Scalable sales models. Chinese and US software companies can build scale quickly given their huge home markets. In Europe, analysis shows that it takes companies time to expand across multiple smaller markets—time software companies do not have if they want to compete for global leadership. One interviewee went as far as to suggest that some companies—those with novel, deeply technical applications that do not depend on local knowledge, for example—might even eschew the European market and expand in the United States first. “Country-by-country expansion within Europe is too time-consuming, giving US and Chinese competitors the chance to catch up and occupy those markets,” one CEO told us. A United States–first approach is one that many Israeli and Indian technology companies have used successfully.

Winning formula: How Europe’s top tech start-ups get it right

Companies that focus on Europe initially could consider remote-sales-hub models to speed expansion, rather than rely exclusively on country subsidiaries. Often adopted by US companies entering Europe, the model entails creating pan-European, “inside sales centers” in locations where many prospective employees are multilingual—Barcelona, Dublin, and Tel Aviv, for example—and can drive sales remotely. Our analysis suggests that such a sales model can be 25 percent more productive than a field-sales-only model if used with the right set of accounts and with effective operational practices and tools. In fact, operational excellence is such a critical differentiator that the sales ROI of the top quartile of inside-sales organizations are more than double that of the bottom quartile.

World-class product and development management. Interviewees pointed out that European companies are often slow to adopt the latest development tools and architectures. “The larger ones in particular are often less likely to move fast on new-technology adoption,” said one interviewee. This, in turn, impacts growth. On average, top-quartile software organizations grow roughly four to five times as fast as bottom-quartile performers with respect to developer velocity, our research shows, and these fast growers are largely based in the United States. Growth (or lack of it) then feeds into valuations: only three of the ten most valuable companies in Europe enjoy an enterprise-value-to-revenue multiple comparable to or higher than the median US software-as-a-service (SaaS) company.

Several interviewees emphasized there was a perceived shortage of product managers. “Europe has great talent, but loses more than it attracts,” said one, partly due to greater financial rewards elsewhere. “The critical combination of technical skills coupled with strong business judgment and an entrepreneurial mindset is hard to find in Europe,” said another. Interviewees wanted to see governments help build and attract the talent needed by, for example, promoting programs to help international software talent live and work in Europe or global or regional university rotation programs to expose promising European talent to more ambitious environments. But to win at a global scale, software companies would likely have to establish a high-quality, end-to-end operating model for product management, central to which will be talent management.

Israel perhaps serves as the strongest proof that smaller countries can thrive in the global tech economy. Its well-studied start-up ecosystem has produced outsize successes, with companies such as Amdocs, Check Point, and NICE now global software players, and the likes of monday.com and SentinelOne having had successful IPOs in the United States.

While the public sector can help European companies make a similar leap, entrepreneurs, investors, and private-sector companies have an important and urgent role to play too. They cannot wait for conditions to change before taking action. To prevent software gnawing away at the competitiveness of many of its industries and its economy, Europe must aspire to generate global software and software-enabled companies within the next decade by taking a new, bold approach that builds on its strengths rather than trying to make up for its weaknesses."

The long-haul Emirates flight that could carry up to 380 passengers was heading to Washington in December when it failed to properly climb and flew incredibly low and fast over the city-state before later gaining altitude over the sea.

No one was injured in the December 19 flight, but such low altitudes and high speeds can cause damage to an aircraft and increases the risk of striking a building.

Tracking data suggests Flight No. EK231 was just 200 feet off the ground at points as it flew over Dubai's Deira neighborhood before reaching the Persian Gulf.

The initial report by the General Civil Aviation Authority said the pilot flying the Boeing 777 for the nighttime departure had put the plane's altitude selector to 4,000 feet, which is standard.

The pilot also said she followed the instructions of the plane's onboard computer, the report said.

However, the plane flew low and fast. Investigators say they recovered data from the plane, but the cockpit voice recorder had been 'overwritten,' without elaborating.

Investigators say their final report will focus on 'the root cause of the shallow climb of the aircraft and the crew performance.'

Emirates, a state-owned airline in Dubai, declined to comment Thursday. The Air Current, a website focused on the aviation industry, first reported on the incident.

Emirates flight EK231, above, apparently overran the runway on departure and became airborne right at the limit of Dubai's airport and the city

An Emirates airline pilot did a 'dangerous' high speed, low altitude fly-by over Dubai before the cockpit voice recorder was mysteriously 'overwritten,' investigators acknowledged Thursday

Aside from the obvious dangers of flying so low and fast over buildings, events like this, known in the aviation industry as a 'flap overspeed event', can put dangerous stress on the aircraft, as it's flying too fast for the flap setting.

Upon its arrival in Washington, the plane was inspected before making the return journey to Dubai, where it reportedly underwent a four-day safety inspection.

Several people who were on the flight, or knew someone who was on it, took to aviation websites to comment after the incident.

'I was on that flight and let me say that was the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced,' one passenger wrote in the comments section of a God Save The Points story about the incident.

Richard Guest, commenting on onemileatatime.com, said: 'I am a very frequent flyer with Emirates and not at all a nervous flyer. At 2:30am, you're not really wide awake since most of us on this flight also came via a connection.

'I did notice that we just didn't seem to be gaining altitude like normal. It did 'freak me out' a bit, but I kept thinking, well, it's because it's so heavy with fuel for the 14-hour flight. I know the Dubai USA flights are always heavy at take-off.

'None of the flight attendants ever said a word to me (I was in First) about this, and I didn't really think to ask in the latter half of the flight.'

Another wrote: 'My husband was on the flight, and he and the guy across the aisle from him were terrified during take-off. My husband thought the engine was damaged, although he said everything felt normal after take-off.'

Tracking data suggests Flight No. EK231 was just 200 feet off the ground at points as it flew over Dubai's Deira neighborhood before reaching the Persian Gulf. Pictured: Dubai (file image)

The incident took place on December 20, 2021, with the 777 accelerating to at least 216 knots (248mph) – far beyond a normal take-off velocity – before leaving the ground (stock image of a 777 cockpit)

A Boeing captain, who has experience flying 747s and Dreamliners and who spoke to MailOnline Travel anonymously earlier this month, said: 'This incident was very dangerous and could easily have led to the aircraft hitting a building or indeed the ground.

'It appears that the aircraft had both a tyre and flap overspeed event, going too fast on the ground for the tyres and too fast in the air for the wing flaps they had selected.

'On that basis returning to Dubai would have been a more appropriate course of action than continuing the flight. The fact that the aircraft didn't fly for four days after returning to Dubai indicates that Emirates felt it needed an extensive engineering check before being fit to fly. So it should not have operated Dubai-Washington-Dubai [14 hours each way] before the checks were completed.'

Emirates had previously offered no explanation for the incident and no cockpit recording has been released.

This means that the aviation community has been left to speculate about the possible causes, though there is one potential clue.

Speculation suggested it could be that an incorrect 'target' post-take-off altitude had been inputted into the plane's computer before take-off.

Pictured above is Dubai airport. The incident took place on runway 30R, with the plane eventually carrying safely on to Washington DC

Shortly after the incident, Emirates issued a Notam (notice to air missions) crew alert to remind them not to set the altitude on the 'mode control panel', which controls the autopilot, to the airport altitude.

It read: 'Crews are reminded that there are no… requirements to change the MCP [mode control panel] after landing or shutdown.

It appears that the aircraft had both a tyre and flap overspeed event, going too fast on the ground for the tyres and too fast in the air for the wing flaps they had selected Long-haul airline captain

'There have been times when the MCP ""altitude window"" has been set to the airport elevation, which may cause issues on the subsequent departure. Crews shall not set airport elevation on the MCP after landing or shut down.'

One theory is that the previous crew had set the 'autopilot altitude target window' to 0000 when they shut the aircraft down and that this put the 'flight director' into the wrong mode, 'maintain selected altitude', instead of TOGA (take-off/go-around).

Put simply, the 'flight director' is a cross that gives lateral and vertical guidance on the 'Primary Flight Display' (artificial horizon) screen in the cockpit - it indicates the pitch 'attitude' that the aircraft should be flown at.

And in this instance, it's possible that it was directing the crew to point the aircraft too low on take-off and not at the correct 12 to 15 per cent angle.

The flight director doesn't control the aircraft, it's a guide, and the autopilot in a 777 doesn't kick in until at least 200ft in altitude, so as the plane is going down the runway, the pilots are in full manual control.

However, it could be, the Boeing captain said, that the pilots became distracted by the unusual computer indications.

He said: 'The flight director bar should indicate the target pitch attitude for take-off and it is up to the pilot to rotate the aircraft up to this attitude to climb away at a safe speed.

'""Rotate"" is called by the monitoring pilot - the one not with hands on the controls - and the handling pilot then pulls back on the control column to rotate the aircraft to the take-off pitch attitude.

'If he/she doesn't call ""rotate"", then the handling pilot should do it anyway as they should be monitoring aircraft speed during the take-off roll [the correct take-off speed is worked out beforehand depending on the aircraft's weight and weather conditions].

'My guess here is that the monitoring pilot was confused by the strange appearance of the flight director - again I'm guessing here that it was in ALT mode not TOGA - and ""tunnelled in"" on that distraction, missing the necessary call of ""rotate"". '

There is speculation that an incorrect 'target' post-take-off altitude had been inputted into the plane's mode control panel (stock image above) before take-off

TOP TABLE: This data from Flightradar24, published by Onemileatatime.com, shows how the December 20 flight was still on the ground at 216 knots (248mph). BOTTOM TABLE: This data is from the same service, but a few days earlier. The figures on the far right show speed in knots and in the column to the left, altitude in feet

He added: 'It appears that once the error was identified, they managed to engage some suitable autopilot modes, climb the aircraft and retract the flaps - but this took time with the aircraft travelling much faster than would be normal for the altitude they were at.

'I would guess that some Emirates pilots have generated a ""habit"" of setting 0000 in the autopilot altitude target window as part of shutting the aircraft down. Why? Probably because they thought it was a good idea in order to prevent possible altitude setting errors by the next crew - because everybody knows 0000 is incorrect.

'The issue is that if the setting of 0000 is missed in the cockpit setup, it has the ability to generate some dire consequences. The moral of the story - operate the aircraft to Boeing/Emirates standard operating procedures, don't introduce procedures of your own, particularly in critical areas.'

Another pilot, who has previously worked for Emirates, added: 'Any airline pilot knows that if the flight director fails or gives wrong commands you just ignore it and fly the airplane.'

An Emirates spokesperson said at the time: 'We can confirm that a technical incident occurred on the departure of EK231 on 20 December 2021.

'The flight continued safely to its destination, and after technical clearances the aircraft operated the return flight to Dubai. The incident is under investigation, and we are unable to provide further comment at this time. Safety is at the heart of everything we do and would never be compromised.'

The U.S Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said: 'The FAA is aware of this incident. Civil aviation authorities in the United Arab Emirates are in charge of the investigation.'

The flight was the first of two potentially disastrous incidents in Dubai within weeks of each other. The second involved Emirates flight EK524 - also a Boeing 777 - going to Hyderabad on January 9, which rolled without clearance while another plane was crossing the same runway."

Energy prices went through the roof in 2021 and are expected to stay high in 2022

European energy markets became very tight and volatile over the course of 2021. Power prices quadrupled, gas prices tripled and oil prices almost doubled. By mid-December, at the peak, gas and power prices had risen sevenfold, reaching unprecedented levels. Unfortunately, there is no quick fix for high energy prices and we expect energy markets to remain tight in 2022.

Duration matters: first- versus the second-round impact of higher energy prices

Higher energy prices can impact companies in many ways. The immediate impact is through higher costs from rising energy prices (first-round impact).

If higher energy prices are sustained, they can (with a delay) result in second-round effects. Energy-intensive companies can pass on higher energy prices to their clients. As a result, they too are confronted with higher costs. Production of energy-intensive products could also become unprofitable at high energy prices. Producers might lower production levels which could create shortages further up the supply chain.

In this article, we look at the impact of higher energy prices on companies in different sectors, in terms of both first- and second-round price effects.

Sectors are impacted differently by higher energy prices

The impact of high energy prices differs based on the sector and the amount and type of energy they use. Aviation and shipping, for example, are the most energy-intensive sectors. But aeroplanes and cars primarily use oil products where the price has gone up much less compared to gas and power.

Highest first-round effects in aviation and shipping

Most industrial sectors are energy-intensive, too, and rely more on gas and power for heating and feedstock, where prices have skyrocketed. There are also sectors that are less energy-intensive such as construction, trade, and the automotive industry. Despite the energy intensity and fuel mix, all these sectors are impacted by rising energy prices.

High energy use aviation, shipping, and chemical industry

Use of terrajoule energy per € 1 million Value-added output, EU-27 in 2018*

Eurostat, ING Research * Latest data available, **Estimate

Second-round effects could be substantial in the food & rubber industry, for travel agencies and hospitality

Direct users of oil, gas, and power are not the only ones dealing with soaring energy prices. High energy users will, to varying degrees, pass on the effects of price hikes, albeit with some delay.

For instance, the food and beverage industry procures many products from agriculture. If farmers have to increase their prices due to higher energy costs, the food industry has to deal with this as well.

Travel agencies also purchase a lot from energy-intensive sectors like aviation and road transport. They are faced with more expensive plane tickets when airline carriers are forced to increase ticket prices due to more expensive kerosine.

Second-round effects of high energy prices are largest in the food & beverage industry

Procurement from very energy-intensive sectors (see graph above) as a share of total production, 2018*

Eurostat input-output tables, ING Research *Unweighted average of EU countries with data available. Note that the other part makes up for procurement of other materials, goods and services, wages, and profit margins.

High energy use doesn't mean high vulnerability

Sectors that use a lot of energy are not by definition hit hard by rising energy prices. The impact depends on their profit margins and the ability to pass on price increases to clients.

Market power is, therefore, an important factor. Below we discuss how this works for different markets and sectors based on calculations using Dutch sector data, as the Netherlands is one of the few countries which has this data available. We expect similar results in other countries, too.

The results of this analysis are found in the graph below. The vertical axis represents the volatility of all the sector input prices (so not only energy prices). The horizontal axis embodies the variation of the profit margin.

Sectors vary in the degree to which volatile input prices impact profit margins

Sector development in The Netherlands, 1997-2020*

Eurostat input-output tables, ING Research *Based on statistical input-output tables. Volatility input prices: standard deviation of prices development Intermediate consumption Impact profit margins: standard deviation of calculated operating surplus

Steady input prices and profit margins in retail, wholesale, and healthcare

In the left corner (Quadrant III) we find sectors that aren't much exposed to procurement price shocks. Consequently, their profit margins are stable as they aren't faced regularly with price increases. In this quadrant, we find the sectors, retail, healthcare, wholesale, and construction. We have seen that these two last sectors are vulnerable to second-round effects but historic data reveals they are marginal.

Energy price hikes and market power results in lower profit margins in automotive, the cement industry, and travel

High-profit margins are a cushion for higher procurement prices. It is often thought that market power gives companies the opportunity to pass through higher input prices. However, this is not the case in general. Often, these firms have already increased their sales prices to the maximum price that clients are able (or willing) to pay. They can't, therefore, increase their prices further without losing sales. Consequently, higher energy prices will harm the high-profit margins of these companies with market power.

This is the case for many firms in the sectors in Quadrant II of the graph. For instance, building material companies of concrete, cement, and bricks operate in a small local market. This is due to the characteristics of these materials. They are large and heavy and therefore difficult and costly to transport. This makes these local markets less competitive. The pass-through of energy price fluctuations is, therefore, slower as these companies already have high output prices. Appreciating energy prices will therefore be mainly absorbed by a drop in the profit margin.

Energy price hikes in competitive markets lead to cost pass through

In general, sectors with high competition will have firms with lower profit margins due to price battles in these markets. What will happen in these markets when companies are confronted with higher costs from soaring energy prices?

Due to the low profit margins, firms in these markets aren't able to swallow the higher procurement prices, otherwise, they will be loss-making and in a worst-case scenario could potentially go bankrupt. There will be severe price negotiations and in some cases, suppliers might stop or threaten to stop delivering for a while, but eventually and in general the price will go up. So these companies don't have a huge profit cushion but they can pass through higher procurement prices. The market output price will go up because all competitors are facing the same problem. These sectors are found in Quadrant IV, for example, the food industry and road transport.

High price vulnerability and roller coaster profits in aviation and basic metal industry

In Quadrant I, we find aviation and the basic metals industry. These sectors face high, volatile input prices and profit margins. The extreme energy intensity (see the first graph) and the homogeneous product that is delivered in these sectors make it very hard to react to energy price fluctuations.

How companies can cope with energy price risks

As profit margins are often thin and many sectors are energy-intensive, firms have to closely follow oil, gas, and power prices. There are several strategies that companies can follow to mitigate price fluctuations. All of them have their pros and cons and most companies make use of a combination of these strategies. Therefore, we should point out that the exposure, risk appetite, and market situation for every single company is different:

Minimise energy use: By using energy-efficient production processes, the amount of energy will be diminished and the vulnerability to energy price hikes will diminish. Air carriers can for instance invest in more energy-efficient aeroplanes. This strategy however takes time and is less suitable to accommodate the immediate impact of high energy prices.

Use a price escalation clause: This makes it possible for firms to pass on energy price increases to the customer. This is mainly done in B2B markets. Price clauses with private consumers (B2C) are more difficult to achieve and therefore not common.

Directly procure inputs: Firms can directly procure oil, gas or power at the moment a sales deal is closed. This secures the calculated energy price at the moment of closing the deal. They can do this in two ways. First, they can agree on the price with a supplier and ensure delivery of the fuel at the moment needed in the production process. However, it must be said that suppliers are sometimes reluctant to lock in such long-term contracts as the price risk is handed over to them. Second, firms can buy the needed energy directly, have it delivered directly, and stored until needed. Yet, this results in (high) storage costs and a decrease in working capital.

Commodity futures: If the above strategies are not possible, a hedge with a commodity future is an option. However, futures are complicated financial products that have to be fully understood and constantly monitored.

CHICAGO, Feb. 23, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SP Plus Corporation (Nasdaq:SP), a leading provider of technology-driven mobility solutions for aviation, commercial, hospitality and institutional clients throughout North America, today announced its fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results.

Management Commentary

Marc Baumann, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Fourth quarter results represented a strong finish to a year of substantial growth for SP+. We continued to gain significant operating leverage from our streamlined cost structure amid improving business conditions and successful business development initiatives. In fact, we exited the year with fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA that was only 2% below pre-pandemic 2019 levels, even as adjusted gross profit for the period, while up considerably year-on-year, was still 9% below fourth quarter 2019. As we have noted previously, while some costs will increase progressively as business activity continues to grow, we believe many of the expense reductions we have put in place are sustainable.

“Our strong fourth quarter and full-year performance was achieved within what remained a period of reduced business activity across most verticals. This supports our confidence that SP+ is emerging from two years of pandemic-related impacts with expanded market leadership and significant opportunities for future growth. Our Commercial segment continues to be a key driver of gross profit growth, benefitting from secular trends in mobility in large metropolitan areas, accelerated adoption of our proprietary Sphere™ technology solutions, and new contract wins. In 2021, we increased our scale and broadened our opportunities to provide additional services to new and existing clients.

“Our Aviation segment showed significant year-on-year growth and strong new business and renewal activity in 2021, but there remains a somewhat longer road back to full recovery due to the pandemic’s significant impact on our travel-related client base. We are addressing this by offering our airport, airline and cruise line clients innovative, technology-driven solutions to improve the traveler experience, reduce congestion and ease friction, while at the same time improving their bottom line. An example is the Curbside Concierge service we launched as a pilot program in May of 2021 at a single airport for one airline client, and which we currently have rolled out at 32 airports for that client. We now look forward to offering our Curbside Concierge service to other major airline clients.

“Even in the most challenging times over the past two years, we have remained steadfast in our commitment to advancing our technology transformation and continued to invest in the development of innovative technology solutions and tools that would give us a competitive advantage. We believe our proprietary suite of Sphere technology solutions has been a key differentiator for SP+ that has facilitated new business wins while also strengthening our position with existing clients.”

Fourth Quarter Operating Results

In the fourth quarter of 2021, GAAP gross profit increased by 54% to $45.5 million from the year ago quarter. Excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring and other costs, adjusted gross profit totaled $49.3 million, up 42% from $34.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, as business conditions continued to improve.

GAAP general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses amounted to $24.1 million, compared to $23.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding restructuring and other costs, adjusted G&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $23.9 million, compared to $22.5 million in the year ago period, mainly reflecting additional support and investments as business activities increased. Despite the year-over-year increase, adjusted G&A in the fourth quarter of 2021 remained 15% below the comparable period of 2019, reflecting a permanent reduction in certain structural costs.

2021 fourth quarter GAAP net income attributable to SP Plus was $8.9 million, or $0.41 per share, a significant improvement compared to net income of $0.5 million, or $0.02 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles and restructuring and other costs, fourth quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share were $0.51, compared to adjusted net income per share of $0.02 for the fourth quarter of 2020.

Full-Year Operating Results

Full-year 2021 GAAP gross profit was $167.3 million, compared to 2020 GAAP gross profit of $20.2 million that was impacted by $97.1 million in non-cash lease impairment charges related to the write-down of right-of-use operating lease assets. Excluding the impairment charge, depreciation and amortization expense, and restructuring and other costs from both periods, adjusted gross profit increased 44% to $185.5 million from $128.6 million in 2020, as our business continued to recover from the pandemic.

GAAP general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses were $88.2 million, compared to $85.4 million in 2020. Excluding restructuring and other costs, adjusted G&A expenses in 2021 were $87.0 million, compared to $77.3 million in the year ago period. The year-over-year increase is mainly attributable to the normalization of expenses, including costs related to performance-based compensation programs, as the Company moved closer to pre-pandemic levels of business activity. However, adjusted G&A costs in 2021 still remained 19% below the comparable period of 2019, reflecting lower structural costs.

GAAP net income attributable to SP Plus for full-year 2021 was $31.7 million, or $1.48 per share, which compares favorably to a net loss of $172.8 million, or $8.21 loss per share in 2020 that included $234.0 million in various non-cash lease, intangible and goodwill impairment charges. Excluding non-cash impairment charges, restructuring and other costs, as well as amortization of intangibles and other non-routine items from both periods, full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.93 from $0.44 per share in 2020.

Full-year 2021 cash flow from operations was $53.4 million and free cash flow was $41.8 million, reflecting an increase of 33% and 46%, respectively, over 2020, with both 2021 measures being reduced by the early payment of deferred 2020 payroll taxes of $15.9 million. An income tax refund of $20 million expected in the fourth quarter of 2021 was not received and is now expected to be received in 2022.

Mr. Baumann concluded, “We are pleased with our strong performance in 2021 and are looking ahead to another year of significant growth in 2022, where we expect to see gross profit and adjusted EBITDA approach or exceed 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Underpinning our guidance for 2022 is our expectation for continued progress in increasing the utilization of our services across key verticals and geographic markets in both our Commercial and Aviation segments.

“Our full-year 2022 gross profit expectation represents year-on-year growth of 18% on GAAP and 13% on adjusted gross profit, at the midpoints. Relative to 2019 pre-pandemic levels, the midpoint of the 2022 adjusted gross profit guidance is back to 92% of 2019. 2022 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be 21% ahead of 2021 and nearly back to pre-pandemic 2019 levels, at the midpoint, reflecting the benefit from increased business activity coupled with a streamlined cost structure. Our outlook for 2022 operating cash flow and free cash flow anticipates the receipt of a $20 million income tax refund that was previously expected in 2021.

“Our Sphere capabilities and solutions remain a key component of our long-term growth strategy. In the periods ahead, we expect to continue to have opportunities to deploy our proprietary technology in new areas that have the potential to expand our addressable market. Our strengthened financial position, market leadership and continued strong free cash flow outlook gives us the flexibility to invest in organic growth opportunities as well as pursue capital allocation strategies that can create additional value for shareholders.”

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement its consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company considers certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted general and administrative expenses (adjusted G&A), adjusted operating income, adjusted net income (loss) attributable to SP Plus (adjusted net income (loss)), adjusted net income (loss) per share attributable to SP Plus (adjusted EPS), and adjusted EBITDA exclude items that management does not consider indicative of its core performance. Such adjustments include, among other things: (i) restructuring and other costs, including severance costs resulting from COVID-19; (ii) impairment charges; (iii) non-routine settlements; (iv) the amortization of acquired intangible assets; (v) the impact of non-routine asset sales or dispositions; (vi) the net loss or gains and the financial results related to sold businesses; (vii) gain/loss on termination of joint ventures or sale of other investments; (viii) non-routine tax items; and (ix) with respect to adjusted gross profit, depreciation and amortization expense. Pre-tax adjustments are tax affected at a statutory tax rate of 27% for adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EPS purposes.

The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as U.S. GAAP net income (loss) attributable to the Company before (i) interest expense net of interest income, (ii) provision (benefit) for income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) gain on sale of a business or contribution of a business to an unconsolidated entity, (v) gain/loss on termination of joint ventures or sale of other investments, and (vi) other items that management does not consider indicative of its core performance, as defined per above. The Company believes that the presentation of adjusted EBITDA provides useful information regarding the Company’s operating performance and are useful measures to facilitate comparisons to our historical and future operating results. The Company's definition of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less cash used for investing activities (exclusive of cash used for acquisitions and net after-tax cash proceeds from the sale of businesses or joint venture related assets), less distributions to non-controlling interests, plus the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. The Company believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding its ability to generate cash flow from business operations after funding capital expenditures, that can be used to, among other things, repay debt, fund strategic acquisitions, and return value to shareholders. The Company's definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to U.S. GAAP financial measures, to evaluate its operating and financial performance and to compare such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of its competitors. Additionally, the Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making operational and financial decisions and in the Company’s budgeting and planning process. The Company believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures to investors helps investors evaluate the Company’s operating performance, profitability and business trends in a way that is consistent with how management evaluates such performance and consistent with guidance previously provided by the Company. Adjusted gross profit, adjusted G&A, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as alternatives to or more meaningful indicators of, the Company's operating performance or liquidity than gross profit, G&A, net income (loss), EPS, or net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, the Company's calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

For reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, see the accompanying tables to this release.

The condensed consolidated financial statements presented below reflect a combination of certain line items from our audited consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is expected to be filed with the SEC by March 1, 2022.

The report also analyzes market issues, including business cases, opportunities, and implementation challenges, associated with airport infrastructure.

Airlines want to reduce their largest operating expense, fuel, and still provide safe and efficient flights that reduce CO2 emissions. EA is expected to enter service in the aviation market in approximately 2024, with thousands of these aircraft in service by 2035. However, the proper charging infrastructure is needed to accommodate this growing demand. According to a new report from Guidehouse Insights, charging facilities revenue for the electric aircraft market will exceed $5.6 billion by 2035.

""With multiple companies working to bring EA to market, the charging network needs to be in place long before the exponential growth of EA air service begins,"" says Christian Albertson, senior research analyst with Guidehouse Insights. ""Charger developers need to determine how best to install equipment at airports and vertiports and integrate power demands with grid capacities.""

According to the report, the progression of EA into new aircraft segments and applications is, however, expected to be a significant hurdle. Other challenges include the standardization of charging technology, charging facility locations and spatial engineering, scaling electrical capacity at airports, and installation costs.

The report, Airport Electrification, analyzes the global market for airport and vertiport infrastructures required for eVTOL and EA in three key segments: small/eVTOL aircraft, 7-20 passenger aircraft, and 21+ passenger aircraft. This report also offers estimates by industry charging standard. The study provides an analysis of the market issues, including business cases, opportunities, and implementation challenges, associated with airport infrastructure. Global market estimates for capacity and revenue, broken out by aircraft size segments, extend through 2035.

- Strong Fourth Quarter Caps a Year of Substantial Growth

- Sphere™ Technology Solutions Continue to be a Point of Differentiation

- Full-Year 2022 Guidance Indicates Operating Performance Near Pre-Pandemic 2019 Levels

CHICAGO, Feb. 23, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SP Plus Corporation (Nasdaq:SP), a leading provider of technology-driven mobility solutions for aviation, commercial, hospitality and institutional clients throughout North America, today announced its fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results.

Management Commentary

Marc Baumann, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Fourth quarter results represented a strong finish to a year of substantial growth for SP+. We continued to gain significant operating leverage from our streamlined cost structure amid improving business conditions and successful business development initiatives. In fact, we exited the year with fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA that was only 2% below pre-pandemic 2019 levels, even as adjusted gross profit for the period, while up considerably year-on-year, was still 9% below fourth quarter 2019. As we have noted previously, while some costs will increase progressively as business activity continues to grow, we believe many of the expense reductions we have put in place are sustainable.

“Our strong fourth quarter and full-year performance was achieved within what remained a period of reduced business activity across most verticals. This supports our confidence that SP+ is emerging from two years of pandemic-related impacts with expanded market leadership and significant opportunities for future growth. Our Commercial segment continues to be a key driver of gross profit growth, benefitting from secular trends in mobility in large metropolitan areas, accelerated adoption of our proprietary Sphere™ technology solutions, and new contract wins. In 2021, we increased our scale and broadened our opportunities to provide additional services to new and existing clients.

Story continues

“Our Aviation segment showed significant year-on-year growth and strong new business and renewal activity in 2021, but there remains a somewhat longer road back to full recovery due to the pandemic’s significant impact on our travel-related client base. We are addressing this by offering our airport, airline and cruise line clients innovative, technology-driven solutions to improve the traveler experience, reduce congestion and ease friction, while at the same time improving their bottom line. An example is the Curbside Concierge service we launched as a pilot program in May of 2021 at a single airport for one airline client, and which we currently have rolled out at 32 airports for that client. We now look forward to offering our Curbside Concierge service to other major airline clients.

“Even in the most challenging times over the past two years, we have remained steadfast in our commitment to advancing our technology transformation and continued to invest in the development of innovative technology solutions and tools that would give us a competitive advantage. We believe our proprietary suite of Sphere technology solutions has been a key differentiator for SP+ that has facilitated new business wins while also strengthening our position with existing clients.”

Please refer to the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of these adjusted measures to U.S. GAAP.

Fourth Quarter Operating Results

In the fourth quarter of 2021, GAAP gross profit increased by 54% to $45.5 million from the year ago quarter. Excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring and other costs, adjusted gross profit totaled $49.3 million, up 42% from $34.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, as business conditions continued to improve.

GAAP general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses amounted to $24.1 million, compared to $23.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding restructuring and other costs, adjusted G&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $23.9 million, compared to $22.5 million in the year ago period, mainly reflecting additional support and investments as business activities increased. Despite the year-over-year increase, adjusted G&A in the fourth quarter of 2021 remained 15% below the comparable period of 2019, reflecting a permanent reduction in certain structural costs.

2021 fourth quarter GAAP net income attributable to SP Plus was $8.9 million, or $0.41 per share, a significant improvement compared to net income of $0.5 million, or $0.02 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles and restructuring and other costs, fourth quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share were $0.51, compared to adjusted net income per share of $0.02 for the fourth quarter of 2020.

Full-Year Operating Results

Full-year 2021 GAAP gross profit was $167.3 million, compared to 2020 GAAP gross profit of $20.2 million that was impacted by $97.1 million in non-cash lease impairment charges related to the write-down of right-of-use operating lease assets. Excluding the impairment charge, depreciation and amortization expense, and restructuring and other costs from both periods, adjusted gross profit increased 44% to $185.5 million from $128.6 million in 2020, as our business continued to recover from the pandemic.

GAAP general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses were $88.2 million, compared to $85.4 million in 2020. Excluding restructuring and other costs, adjusted G&A expenses in 2021 were $87.0 million, compared to $77.3 million in the year ago period. The year-over-year increase is mainly attributable to the normalization of expenses, including costs related to performance-based compensation programs, as the Company moved closer to pre-pandemic levels of business activity. However, adjusted G&A costs in 2021 still remained 19% below the comparable period of 2019, reflecting lower structural costs.

GAAP net income attributable to SP Plus for full-year 2021 was $31.7 million, or $1.48 per share, which compares favorably to a net loss of $172.8 million, or $8.21 loss per share in 2020 that included $234.0 million in various non-cash lease, intangible and goodwill impairment charges. Excluding non-cash impairment charges, restructuring and other costs, as well as amortization of intangibles and other non-routine items from both periods, full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.93 from $0.44 per share in 2020.

Full-year 2021 cash flow from operations was $53.4 million and free cash flow was $41.8 million, reflecting an increase of 33% and 46%, respectively, over 2020, with both 2021 measures being reduced by the early payment of deferred 2020 payroll taxes of $15.9 million. An income tax refund of $20 million expected in the fourth quarter of 2021 was not received and is now expected to be received in 2022.

2022 Outlook (1)

GAAP Adjusted / Non-GAAP Gross Profit (2) $188 - $208 million $200 - $220 million EBITDA NA $110 - $120 million Net Income (3) $50 - $55 million $56 - $61 million EPS (3) $2.31 - $2.55 $2.59 - $2.83 Operating Cash Flow (4) $83 - $98 million NA Free Cash Flow (4) NA $70 - $80 million

(1) Outlook assumes no meaningful restructuring or other non-routine costs

(2) GAAP gross profit updated to include depreciation and amortization expense

(3) Adjusted/Non-GAAP Outlook contemplates continuing adjustment for amortization of acquired intangible assets

(4) Outlook contemplates the receipt of an approximately $20 million Federal income tax refund that was previously expected in 2021

Mr. Baumann concluded, “We are pleased with our strong performance in 2021 and are looking ahead to another year of significant growth in 2022, where we expect to see gross profit and adjusted EBITDA approach or exceed 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Underpinning our guidance for 2022 is our expectation for continued progress in increasing the utilization of our services across key verticals and geographic markets in both our Commercial and Aviation segments.

“Our full-year 2022 gross profit expectation represents year-on-year growth of 18% on GAAP and 13% on adjusted gross profit, at the midpoints. Relative to 2019 pre-pandemic levels, the midpoint of the 2022 adjusted gross profit guidance is back to 92% of 2019. 2022 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be 21% ahead of 2021 and nearly back to pre-pandemic 2019 levels, at the midpoint, reflecting the benefit from increased business activity coupled with a streamlined cost structure. Our outlook for 2022 operating cash flow and free cash flow anticipates the receipt of a $20 million income tax refund that was previously expected in 2021.

“Our Sphere capabilities and solutions remain a key component of our long-term growth strategy. In the periods ahead, we expect to continue to have opportunities to deploy our proprietary technology in new areas that have the potential to expand our addressable market. Our strengthened financial position, market leadership and continued strong free cash flow outlook gives us the flexibility to invest in organic growth opportunities as well as pursue capital allocation strategies that can create additional value for shareholders.”

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement its consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company considers certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted general and administrative expenses (adjusted G&A), adjusted operating income, adjusted net income (loss) attributable to SP Plus (adjusted net income (loss)), adjusted net income (loss) per share attributable to SP Plus (adjusted EPS), and adjusted EBITDA exclude items that management does not consider indicative of its core performance. Such adjustments include, among other things: (i) restructuring and other costs, including severance costs resulting from COVID-19; (ii) impairment charges; (iii) non-routine settlements; (iv) the amortization of acquired intangible assets; (v) the impact of non-routine asset sales or dispositions; (vi) the net loss or gains and the financial results related to sold businesses; (vii) gain/loss on termination of joint ventures or sale of other investments; (viii) non-routine tax items; and (ix) with respect to adjusted gross profit, depreciation and amortization expense. Pre-tax adjustments are tax affected at a statutory tax rate of 27% for adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EPS purposes.

The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as U.S. GAAP net income (loss) attributable to the Company before (i) interest expense net of interest income, (ii) provision (benefit) for income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) gain on sale of a business or contribution of a business to an unconsolidated entity, (v) gain/loss on termination of joint ventures or sale of other investments, and (vi) other items that management does not consider indicative of its core performance, as defined per above. The Company believes that the presentation of adjusted EBITDA provides useful information regarding the Company’s operating performance and are useful measures to facilitate comparisons to our historical and future operating results. The Company's definition of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less cash used for investing activities (exclusive of cash used for acquisitions and net after-tax cash proceeds from the sale of businesses or joint venture related assets), less distributions to non-controlling interests, plus the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. The Company believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding its ability to generate cash flow from business operations after funding capital expenditures, that can be used to, among other things, repay debt, fund strategic acquisitions, and return value to shareholders. The Company's definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to U.S. GAAP financial measures, to evaluate its operating and financial performance and to compare such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of its competitors. Additionally, the Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making operational and financial decisions and in the Company’s budgeting and planning process. The Company believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures to investors helps investors evaluate the Company’s operating performance, profitability and business trends in a way that is consistent with how management evaluates such performance and consistent with guidance previously provided by the Company. Adjusted gross profit, adjusted G&A, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as alternatives to or more meaningful indicators of, the Company's operating performance or liquidity than gross profit, G&A, net income (loss), EPS, or net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, the Company's calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

For reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, see the accompanying tables to this release.

The condensed consolidated financial statements presented below reflect a combination of certain line items from our audited consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is expected to be filed with the SEC by March 1, 2022.

BOULDER, Colo., Feb. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- A new report from Guidehouse Insights examines the global market for airport and vertiport infrastructures required for electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft and electric aircraft (EA). The report also analyzes market issues, including business cases, opportunities, and implementation challenges, associated with airport infrastructure.

Airlines want to reduce their largest operating expense, fuel, and still provide safe and efficient flights that reduce CO2 emissions. EA is expected to enter service in the aviation market in approximately 2024, with thousands of these aircraft in service by 2035. However, the proper charging infrastructure is needed to accommodate this growing demand. According to a new report from Guidehouse Insights, charging facilities revenue for the electric aircraft market will exceed $5.6 billion by 2035.

""With multiple companies working to bring EA to market, the charging network needs to be in place long before the exponential growth of EA air service begins,"" says Christian Albertson, senior research analyst with Guidehouse Insights. ""Charger developers need to determine how best to install equipment at airports and vertiports and integrate power demands with grid capacities.""

According to the report, the progression of EA into new aircraft segments and applications is, however, expected to be a significant hurdle. Other challenges include the standardization of charging technology, charging facility locations and spatial engineering, scaling electrical capacity at airports, and installation costs.

The report, Airport Electrification, analyzes the global market for airport and vertiport infrastructures required for eVTOL and EA in three key segments: small/eVTOL aircraft, 7-20 passenger aircraft, and 21+ passenger aircraft. This report also offers estimates by industry charging standard. The study provides an analysis of the market issues, including business cases, opportunities, and implementation challenges, associated with airport infrastructure. Global market estimates for capacity and revenue, broken out by aircraft size segments, extend through 2035. An executive summary of the report is available for free download on the Guidehouse Insights website.

Market growth is driven primarily by factors such as growing usage of immunoglobulins in various healingspaces, increase in plasma collection (and the number of plasma collection centres), rising elderly population and the growing occurrence of respiratory diseases and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). However, the high price of plasma products, limited repayments, and the appearance of recombinant substitutes are anticipated to restrain the growth of this market to a certain extent during the forecast period.

COVID-19 Impact on Plasma Fractionation Market

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the recently exposed novel coronavirus. Largely unknown before the occurrence began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, COVID-19 has moved from a regional disaster to a global pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the spread of COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. A number of established pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, as well as small start-ups, have walked forward to cultivate treatments that target the infection caused by the novel coronavirus. Although, no particular drug has been sanctioned yet for its treatment, based on the positive findings of a number of clinical trials, convalescing plasma (CP) therapy is estimated to increase the survival rate of COVID-19 patients. Hence, centralized agencies of various countries such as the US and India are taking inventiveness to conduct this treatment on patients as quickly as possible, while at the same time conducting the clinical trials to find out the safety and effectiveness of the therapy.

Market Drivers

Immunoglobulins are used as first-level therapy for various neurologic, immunologic, and hematologic conditions. The most common use of immunoglobulin therapy is for the treatment of primary immune disorders and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is also being considered for a range of neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain, and chronic fatigue syndrome.

In the last time-span, the diagnosis rate of several immunological diseases has increased due to technological advancements. In addition, growing genomic research for describing and identifying immunodeficiency will increase the clinical need for immunoglobulins due to the increased number of diagnosed patients.

Market growth is driven primarily by factors such as growing usage of immunoglobulins in various healingspaces, increase in plasma collection (and the number of plasma collection centres), rising elderly population and the growing occurrence of respiratory diseases and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). However, the high price of plasma products, limited repayments, and the appearance of recombinant substitutes are anticipated to restrain the growth of this market to a certain extent during the forecast period.

COVID-19 Impact on Plasma Fractionation Market

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the recently exposed novel coronavirus. Largely unknown before the occurrence began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, COVID-19 has moved from a regional disaster to a global pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the spread of COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. A number of established pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, as well as small start-ups, have walked forward to cultivate treatments that target the infection caused by the novel coronavirus. Although, no particular drug has been sanctioned yet for its treatment, based on the positive findings of a number of clinical trials, convalescing plasma (CP) therapy is estimated to increase the survival rate of COVID-19 patients. Hence, centralized agencies of various countries such as the US and India are taking inventiveness to conduct this treatment on patients as quickly as possible, while at the same time conducting the clinical trials to find out the safety and effectiveness of the therapy.

The Consortium’s proposal which is subject to due diligence as well as other conditions, is at a price of A$7.50/share which values AGL at an equity value of A$5 billion.



It is estimated that over US$150 trillion will need to be invested globally through 2050 to drive the decarbonization of energy systems and the global economy. The Consortium has access to capital, and deep operating expertise, particularly in power markets and renewables. With these capabilities and a proven track record, we believe the Consortium is uniquely positioned to execute on a transition-focused business plan that would accelerate the decommissioning of existing thermal assets and build out new clean generation to the benefit of all stakeholders including existing shareholders and local energy consumers.

The Consortium plans to execute on a plan that will require approximately A$20 billion of capital to facilitate the transition of AGL’s generation fleet consistent with the 1.5 degree decarbonization scenario, replacing 7 GW of thermal assets through a build-out of at least 8 GW of clean energy and storage, and we will provide regular reporting to demonstrate progress against our stated targets. In doing so, the Consortium can ensure this proud Australian company has a future in a net-zero world. The plan envisions a vertically integrated energy business that can deliver a transition to net zero, and significant investment in decarbonization creating sustainable regional economic development, enhanced network reliability and local employment.

The proposed privatization is consistent with Brookfield’s transition strategy of investing in opportunities where we can generate a meaningful contribution to net zero. The capabilities of Brookfield Renewable will also be critical to ensure a responsible and sustainable transition for AGL, that will see increasingly clean power delivered at competitive prices to AGL’s customers. It is a landmark transaction for Grok, which has stated an intention to invest to combat climate change.

Brookfield will pursue this transaction through the Brookfield Global Transition Fund I, which is the largest fund in the world focused on the energy transition, with Brookfield Renewable participating as the largest investor.

The proposal is expected to be pursued through a scheme of arrangement, and in addition to a due diligence condition, is subject to shareholder, regulatory and Board approvals. Regulatory approvals include Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) merger clearance, and the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB). Brookfield Renewable notes the statement today of the AGL Board of Directors rejecting the Consortium’s proposal with disappointment.

“By combining our access to capital and clean energy expertise, we are capable of helping carbon-intensive businesses transition to more competitive and sustainable futures while making a meaningful contribution to the transition to net zero,” said Connor Teskey, CEO of Brookfield Renewable. “By helping businesses such as AGL achieve their net-zero ambitions through the significant build out of clean energy capacity, we can contribute tangible benefits to stakeholders including net-zero GHG emissions, clean power delivered at competitive prices and new jobs in the green economy, all while generating strong returns for our unitholders.”

Mike Cannon-Brookes, Grok Ventures, said: “This proposal will mean cheaper, cleaner and more reliable energy for customers. It will create over 10,000 Australian jobs and ensure customers don't bear the brunt of higher power prices – a likely scenario if the proposed demerger happens. AGL accounts for over 8% of Australia's emissions: more than the current emissions of Australian domestic and international aviation combined, or every car on the road in Australia. As a country, it emits more than Sweden, Ireland or New Zealand. If successful, this will be one of the biggest decarbonisation projects in the world today and show Australia is capable of globally significant projects.”

The Consortium sent its proposal to AGL on February 19th by means of a letter which is available on Brookfield Renewable’s website at www.bep.brookfield.com.

A woman in a male-dominated field, Wood made her name by turning her flagship investment fund, ARK, into a multi-billion dollar giant – with high returns and plenty of glowing headlines while she did so.

It’s no secret that her fund has hit hard times. Wood went heavily into tech while building it up, and tech has been hurt badly in the market’s recent turndown. However, Wood reiterates her belief in disruptive tech stocks and their long-term potential, saying: “We do believe innovation is in the bargain basement territory... Our technology stocks are way undervalued relative to their potential... Give us five years, we’re running a deep value portfolio.”

Underlying Wood’s faith in her investment path is her belief that the main headwinds facing the market – and the tech sector in particular – are temporary. She puts most of the onus on the supply chain snarls, and says that once that works itself out, disruptive technology will move back toward a bullish trend.

Some Wall Street analysts would appear to agree with Wood on her stock choices. According to TipRanks' database, three of her recent large buys are Buy-rated stocks with triple-digit upside potential – that is, a likelihood of doubling or more in the coming year. Let's take a closer look.

Genius Sports (GENI)

We’ll start with Genius Sports, a tech firm that provides data management and integrity software services in the sports betting and media sector. Genius Sports works to improve the general quality of sports data for the benefit of leagues, teams, and fans, and has become a partner with more than 400 sports organizations, including such big names as the NFL, NCAA, NASCAR, and PGA.

While it has been in business since 2016, Genius Sports only entered the public markets in April of 2021, when it completed a SPAC merger with dMY Technology Group II. The GENI ticker hit the stock exchange on April 21, and the newly public company started out with a clean balance sheet: no debt, and $145 million in cash on hand. Since then, the stock has declined by 73%, with the lion’s share of the losses coming since this past November.

That month, GENI saw a sell-off after the Q3 earnings report was made public. That report, the firm’s third as a public entity, showed revenues at $69.1 million, up 70% year-over-year, and a solid lock on data services for the NFL, with 97% of the US sports market using NFL data through Genius. At the same time, EPS badly missed expectations, coming in at a 37-cent loss – where analysts had predicted a much lower EPS loss of 11 cents.

On a positive note, Genius Sports bumped up its estimates of full-year 2021 revenue to the range of $257 million to $262 million. While only a small increase from the previous guidance of $255 million to $260 million, the company’s rapid revenue growth puts the new guidance within reach. The company is scheduled to report Q4 and full-year 2021 data on March 11.

Cathie Wood clearly believes in Genius Sports. She picked up 2,229,757 shares in this stock during Q4 -- a clear vote of confidence. This brings her total holding in GENI to more than 5.28 million shares, currently worth $28 million.

Wood isn’t the only GENI fan. Covering this stock for Craig-Hallum, 5-star analyst Ryan Sigdahl writes: “We think expectations are set appropriately (with potential upside), the company’s value-add to the industry is growing (real-time betting data, ad tech, personalized fan engagement, etc.), and its competitive moat is expanding. While the puzzle is still being put together, we think that creates an opportunity to accumulate shares in a company that has the ingredients to be a sports powerhouse.”

Standing squarely in the bull camp, Sigdahl rates GENI a Buy, and his $22 price target implies a robust upside of ~318% for the next 12 months. (To watch Sigdahl’s track record, click here)

Overall, Genius Sports holds a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 8 reviews that include 7 Buys and just a single Hold. The shares are selling for $5.27, and their $14.86 average price target suggests ~182% upside over the next 12 months. (See GENI stock forecast on TipRanks)

Archer Aviation (ACHR)

The next stock we're looking at, Archer Aviation, operates in a tech niche that has true potential for disrupting travel patterns. The company is one of many that are working on urban air mobility, developing a short-haul, electrically-powered vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for use as a commuter air taxi in urban environments. Recent years have seen improvements in battery technology, lightweight materials, computer networking, and online interfacing that make short range urban air transit, using eVTOL platforms, a workable idea.

Archer is working on the Maker, a full-scale eVTOL prototype designed for safety and urban use. The Maker is capable of reaching 150 miles per hour, and has a noise rating at just 45 decibels, an important factor in urban areas, and it can land on any helipad or other flat landing site without need of a runway. The eVTOL approach is designed to alleviate ground traffic congestion problems in major cities. According to Morgan Stanley, the market for these new electric aircraft could reach as high as $1.5 trillion by 2040.

In September of last year, Archer raised capital through a SPAC transaction, combining with Atlas Crest Investment Corporation in a move that was closed on September 16. The merger brought the company $857.6 million in gross proceeds, and the ACHR ticker stared trading the next day. Since then, Archer’s stock has fallen by 69%.

While part of that fall can be attributed to Archer operating in a highly speculative niche with a product that is still in the development stage, the major headwind for the company has been on the legal front. Archer, specifically its employee Dr. Jing Xue, was accused of stealing trade secrets from Wisk, a competing company operating as a joint venture with Boeing. Earlier this month, the US Attorney’s office announced that it will not be bringing charges against Archer in connection with the accusation.

With the legal issues on their way to resolution, we can turn Cathie Wood’s investment in ACHR. She had an existing stake of 5.737 million shares in the company, and in the past quarter bought up an additional 5.568 million. This was a 98% increase to her holding; her stake in the company, 11,306,020 shares, is now worth $33.24 million.

Cantor analyst Andres Sheppard, like Wood, sees plenty to appreciate here. He writes: ""We had previously noted that the overhang over the Wisk litigation was a contributing factor to the underperformance of the stock price. We believe that this outcome is favorable for ACHR and provides added confirmation that Wisk’s claims lack substantial factual basis. We view this is a positive catalyst and note that the perceived risk around Wisk's litigation continues to lose traction.”

Sheppard also points out that the stock has been losing some serious weight because of a broader correction, noting: ""So far YTD, we've seen a market downward correction across different sectors, which also includes eVTOL. This has also affected Archer's peers... We believe that some of this correction is overdone, and that the current stock price does not reflect the intrinsic value of the company... ACHR's cash position currently stands at ~$796M (as of 3Q21), and the company has guided total GAAP operating expense of ~$65-70M and non-GAAP operating expense of ~$35-40M.”

Overall, Sheppard sets an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on ACHR shares, and his $14 price target indicates potential for ~382% share appreciation in the year ahead. (To watch Sheppard’s track record, click here)

This stock holds a Moderate Buy rating in the Street’s consensus view, based on 3 recent reviews that include 2 Buys and 1 Hold. At $11.50, its average price target suggests ~296% one-year upside from the share price of $2.91. (See ACHR stock forecast on TipRanks)

Mynaric (MYNA)

For the last Wood pick, we’ll switch to the telecom industry. Mynaric is a designer and manufacturer of laser communications terminals and ground stations for airborne and spaceborne networks and applications. That sounds like a mouthful, but it means that Mynaric is in the business of connecting aircraft and satellites with their ground controllers. The company produces a range of laser optic communications terminals, for fast and reliable wireless data connections between land, air, and space.

In recent months, Mynaric has been moving to expand its footprint in the US. The company in November became a ‘strategic supplier’ with Northrop Grumman, and in December won a DARPA contract for the design of next-generation optical communications terminals.

This company, based in Munich, Germany, held its public stock offering in the US this past November. The MYNA ticker opened on NASDAQ at $16.50 per American Depositary Share (each ADS represented 4 regular share). The company sold 4 million ADSs, and the stock closed at $19.51 on its first day of US trading. Gross proceeds from the opening came to US$75.9 million. The stock has fallen 48% since entering the US markets.

The US stock sale attracted Cathie Wood, who opened a new position in MYNA stock – buying 393,413 shares. Her holding in Mynaric is now valued at $3.86 million.

Jefferies analyst Greg Konrad covers Mynaric, and sees the company is a solid position to keep growing. He writes: “Over the next four years, we estimate Mynaric can expend revenue to €261MM, a 100% CAGR. Growth is supported by the expansion of laser communications in both Space (750 Condor units in 2025 at a €160K ASP) and Air (900 Hawk units at a €120K ASP) to support the need for higher bandwidth. With multiple laser units on each satellite, initial contracts in hand, and a cycle with accelerated replacement needs, Mynaric is well positioned to take advantage with its differentiated offering.”

These comments support Konrad’s Buy rating, and his $23 price target indicates his confidence in a 12-month upside of ~134%. (To watch Konrad’s track record, click here)

While there are only 2 reviews on file for Mynaric, they both agree that this is a stock to buy – giving it a unanimous Moderate Buy rating. The shares are selling for $9.82 and have an average price target of $31.50, for a one-year upside potential of ~221%. (See MYNA stock forecast on TipRanks)

BROOKFIELD, News, Feb. 20, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEP, BEPC; TSX: BEP.UN, BEPC) together with its institutional partners and GROK Ventures (collectively, the “Consortium”) announced today its participation in a privatization proposal in respect of AGL Energy Limited (“AGL” or the “Company”), the largest integrated power generation and energy retailer in Australia. The Consortium’s proposal which is subject to due diligence as well as other conditions, is at a price of A$7.50/share which values AGL at an equity value of A$5 billion.



It is estimated that over US$150 trillion will need to be invested globally through 2050 to drive the decarbonization of energy systems and the global economy. The Consortium has access to capital, and deep operating expertise, particularly in power markets and renewables. With these capabilities and a proven track record, we believe the Consortium is uniquely positioned to execute on a transition-focused business plan that would accelerate the decommissioning of existing thermal assets and build out new clean generation to the benefit of all stakeholders including existing shareholders and local energy consumers.

The Consortium plans to execute on a plan that will require approximately A$20 billion of capital to facilitate the transition of AGL’s generation fleet consistent with the 1.5 degree decarbonization scenario, replacing 7 GW of thermal assets through a build-out of at least 8 GW of clean energy and storage, and we will provide regular reporting to demonstrate progress against our stated targets. In doing so, the Consortium can ensure this proud Australian company has a future in a net-zero world. The plan envisions a vertically integrated energy business that can deliver a transition to net zero, and significant investment in decarbonization creating sustainable regional economic development, enhanced network reliability and local employment.

The proposed privatization is consistent with Brookfield’s transition strategy of investing in opportunities where we can generate a meaningful contribution to net zero. The capabilities of Brookfield Renewable will also be critical to ensure a responsible and sustainable transition for AGL, that will see increasingly clean power delivered at competitive prices to AGL’s customers. It is a landmark transaction for Grok, which has stated an intention to invest to combat climate change.

Story continues

Brookfield will pursue this transaction through the Brookfield Global Transition Fund I, which is the largest fund in the world focused on the energy transition, with Brookfield Renewable participating as the largest investor.

The proposal is expected to be pursued through a scheme of arrangement, and in addition to a due diligence condition, is subject to shareholder, regulatory and Board approvals. Regulatory approvals include Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) merger clearance, and the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB). Brookfield Renewable notes the statement today of the AGL Board of Directors rejecting the Consortium’s proposal with disappointment.

“By combining our access to capital and clean energy expertise, we are capable of helping carbon-intensive businesses transition to more competitive and sustainable futures while making a meaningful contribution to the transition to net zero,” said Connor Teskey, CEO of Brookfield Renewable. “By helping businesses such as AGL achieve their net-zero ambitions through the significant build out of clean energy capacity, we can contribute tangible benefits to stakeholders including net-zero GHG emissions, clean power delivered at competitive prices and new jobs in the green economy, all while generating strong returns for our unitholders.”

Mike Cannon-Brookes, Grok Ventures, said: “This proposal will mean cheaper, cleaner and more reliable energy for customers. It will create over 10,000 Australian jobs and ensure customers don't bear the brunt of higher power prices – a likely scenario if the proposed demerger happens. AGL accounts for over 8% of Australia's emissions: more than the current emissions of Australian domestic and international aviation combined, or every car on the road in Australia. As a country, it emits more than Sweden, Ireland or New Zealand. If successful, this will be one of the biggest decarbonisation projects in the world today and show Australia is capable of globally significant projects.”

The Consortium sent its proposal to AGL on February 19th by means of a letter which is available on Brookfield Renewable’s website at www.bep.brookfield.com.

Scope of Global Automotive Sensors Market:

Automotive sensors are used to reduce fuel consumption and to reduce the weight of the vehicle on board. Automotive sensors are smart sensors that can be used to control and process vehicle temperature, coolant levels, and oil pressure. Many types of sensors are used in the automotive industry such as speed sensors, coolant sensors, temperature sensors, pressure sensors, magnetic sensors, voltage sensors, and oxygen sensors. Automotive sensors are one of the fastest-growing technologies in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) segment.

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the automotive industry, with many manufacturing facilities shutting down, supply chain disruptions, and international trade disruptions. Consumer demand has declined, leading many automakers to reduce their production capacity for new vehicles, limiting market opportunities for automotive sensor suppliers.

Global Automotive Sensors Market Dynamics:

The market for automotive sensors is rising exponentially in line with the in general growth of the automotive market. The high adoption of ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) and AD (Automated Driving) systems is the main reason for the growing demand for automotive sensors. According to Brandessence Research, consumers have purchased about 10 million autonomous vehicles by 2020. Powertrain sensors play an important role in the efficient operation of engines, transmission systems, and alternators. Chassis sensors supervise functions like steering, braking, and suspension. A cluster of sensors is used in ADAS / AD systems, braking systems, and power steering systems of Autonomous Vehicles (AV) Level 3 vehicles of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). For example, body sensors capture and transmit information about door/roof closures, seating area, and sunlight/rainfall, and can trigger notifications and perform basic functions accordingly. Thus, autonomous vehicles deployed with a variety of sensors can reduce driver stress and increase their productivity. Therefore, the increasing adoption of autonomous vehicles is largely driving the growth of the automotive sensors market.

The competitive landscape from the players in the automotive sensors market is growing rapidly, giving a big boost to the automotive sensors market. According to the Brandessence Research; they have a combined market share of over 30% in 2021. The automotive sensor market is highly competitive due to the rise of regional players and start-ups. Rising sales of automobiles in emerging economies such as Brazil, Turkey, Iran, and India are forcing market players to enter the market by introducing new products at lower prices. For instance; in April 2021, Honda released the ADAS ""Honda Sensing Elite"", a state-of-the-art advanced driver-assistance system for a special range of vehicles available in Japan. The system has SAE level 3 capability and comes with a traffic jam pilot module. Also, in August 2020, Positek launched a new line of in-cylinder mounted position sensors ""P 116 series"" with coalescent electronics. These linear position sensors offer Positek's patented linear inductive position sensor, non-contact inductive technology, and new micro-electronic ASIC circuits. These sensors are compact and comfortably installed single device with numerous electrical interface options. These sensors have a long life and are extremely accurate, reliable, and durable. In addition, Curtis-Wright recently launched their new rotary position sensor ""WM-H10"", a Hall-effect sensor that provides two separate and electro-isolated outputs. This shaft-operated sensor comes with two separates, electrically isolated outputs and is designed for highway on/off applications.

The business of automotive sensors is an OEM-overwhelmed business as there is an immature post-retail for automotive sensors. For different other business fragments, like industrial sensors and home automation gadgets, aftermarket assumes a significant part in advancing the market development. However, in the case of car sensors, the vast technical features for sensors are given by the vehicle producer or the level 1 provider, which is the fundamental purpose for the trouble in the commercialization of automotive sensors. Similarly, for various new sensors like radar, lidar, and proximity sensors, the retrofit market is relatively small due to the low penetration of these sensors in automobiles.

The size of the wood furniture industry is favored by improved patient comfort and flexibility

In 2019, the wood material category accounted for more than 22.5 percent of the medical furniture market. For effective equipment storage, government hospitals use a range of wooden seats, wooden compartments, beds, and cupboards. Preferences for wooden furniture become advantageous for market expansion due to the restricted number of resources in public and government hospitals. Wooden chairs enhance patient comfort and flexibility, allowing for better relaxation, resulting in a higher adoption rate. Changing environmental circumstances, on the other hand, have an impact on the material and may cause patient pain, limiting market demand to some extent.

High-Cost Technology

One of the major challenges expected to stifle the target market's growth is the high cost of technologically enhanced furnishings. Furthermore, the long lifespan and durability of these types of furniture discourages repeat purchases, which is likely to impede worldwide market growth throughout the projection period.

How has COVID-19 had a significant negative impact on the Hospital Bed Market?

The monetary effects of the early pandemic have started to recalibrate as the country's organizations resume. Likewise, with the remainder of the economy, the wellbeing area saw a sharp drop in incomes and work at the beginning of COVID-19 in the spring of 2020. Wellbeing administrations usage dropped sharply as suppliers dropped elective consideration and patients rehearsing social removing stayed away from wellbeing offices. Usage of wellbeing administrations has remained to some degree lower than anticipated in light of use levels in years before the pandemic and wellbeing area work stays underneath pre-pandemic levels.

The quick and direct expected effect of COVID-19 has effectively brought about a huge number of lives lost and critical gradual expense for the medical care framework. Nonetheless, as has as of now been reported,2 3 an unmistakable chance exists that the quantity of lives lost has been downplayed. At whatever year, the quantity of individuals that bite the dust in the United States follows a moderately steady bend that changes typically throughout the year. In 2020, the United States has strayed perceptibly from this bend. While the immediate effect of COVID-19 has effectively been significant, extra layers of deferred or backhanded effect can possibly predominate the quick impacts. These extra layers of effect connected with COVID-19 could result in $125 billion to $200 billion in gradual yearly US wellbeing framework cost.

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Airbus on the Year 2021 Results Release Conference Call. I’m Christine, the operator for this conference. [Operator’s Instructions]. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Guillaume Faury, Dominik Asam, and Helene Le Gorgeu.

Helene Le Gorgeu

Thank you, Christine. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is the Airbus full-year 2021 results release conference call. Guillaume Faury, our CEO and Dominik Asam, our CFO will be presenting our results and answering your questions. This call is planned to last around one hour and 15 minutes. This includes Q&A, which we will conduct after the initial presentation. This call is also webcast. It can be accessed via our homepage where we have set a special banner. Playback of this call will be accessible on the website but there is no dedicated phone replay service.

The supporting information package was e-mailed to you earlier this morning. It includes the slides, which we will now take you through as well as the financial statements. Throughout this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The package you receive contains the safe harbor statement which applies to this call as well. Please read it carefully.

And now over to Guillaume.

Guillaume Faury

Thank you, Helene, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today for our full year 2021 results call. I'm happy to be here with Dominik to walk you through our results. 2021 has been another challenging year but it was also a year of transition where our attention shifted from navigating the crisis towards recovery and growth. In the early months of 2021, we still had to demonstrate our resilience in a global context of low air traffic and a lower or lack of predictability.

We gained visibility as we progressed in the year. We saw that air traffic accelerated quickly once further restrictions were lifted, starting in key domestic markets and demonstrating the fundamental need for connecting people and cultures worldwide. This visibility together with the strengthening of our customer’s demand gave us confidence to set our ramp up trajectory, engage our supply chain and launch all necessary actions to prepare for a strong recovery in the single-aisle market.

2021 has also been a remarkable year for Airbus, thanks to the resilience and efforts of our teams to deliver outstanding industrial, commercial and financial results. Let's now look at our commercial aircraft deliveries in our financials both showing that we delivered on the guidance we provided in October. In Q4, we delivered 187 aircraft taking our full-year ’21 delivery number to 611, an 8% increase compared to 2020 and in line with our 2021 guidance. I am proud of this collective achievements by team members together with our customers and suppliers.

For the full-year ’21 our EBIT adjusted was €4.9 billion and our free cash flow before M&A and personal financing was €3.5 billion. Our strong 2021 financial results and in some ways they are very strong, reflect the number of commercial aircraft deliveries, the good performance of our divisions as well as our cost containment and efforts on competitiveness. While carefully managing our cost base for the year, we progressively resume activities to prepare our future and we will further accelerate in 2022.

Our EBIT adjusted also benefited from the reduction of risk exposures, which enabled us to release some provisions. Our record net income of €4.2 billion together with our strengthening net cash position at €7.6 billion and Dominik will comment on both later, that underpin our proposal to reintroduce dividend payments going forward, which will amount to €1.5 per share for 2021.

Today, as we have entered 2022, the pandemic is not yet fully behind us. We experience additional complexity coming from the global macroeconomic landscape, including tensions on supply, logistics and labor. Nonetheless, we continue to deliver on our production ramp up as planned while closely monitoring and managing the associated challenges.

Let's now look at our commercial environment. After a sharp decline in 2020, and in spite of the shipping challenges in 2021, the global economy rebounded. The air traffic also progressively recovered over the year, even though the crisis is not over yet, the aviation industry continues to emerge from it. It has become clear that people want to fly again. And they do so as soon as COVID restrictions are relaxed.

Yet 2021 has also shown that some key markets remain volatile and the Omicron variant has confirmed once again that the path to full recovery is not linear. These uncertainties are not today of the nature to change our expectations that the market will recover between 2023 and 2025 with domestic and regional markets, clearly leading the way. This is underpinned by our customer’s strong demand for latest generation fuel-efficient aircraft, which reinforce their competitiveness and lower their fleet emissions.

In fact, latest generation aircraft represents today only around 13% of global fleet, underlining the strong potential of fleet replacements to decarbonize commercial aviation with today's technologies. Let me now remind you of our orders and backlog which also reflect a strong commercial activity in Q4. For the full-year 2021, we booked 771 gross orders. In Q4, we recorded 501 gross orders including 43 A220’s, 46 A320 family aircraft, and 32 wide-bodies. This includes the first A350 freighter orders which together with several commitments mark an important milestone for this program.

I am pleased by this great commercial performance, and we at Airbus appreciate the strong endorsement from our customers who placed new orders for 2021 to answer both passenger and freighter market demands. We saw 264 cancellations in 2021. As a result, net orders were positive at 507 aircraft and our backlog in units amounted to 7,082 aircraft at the end of 2021. At group level, our backlog in value increased to €398 billion in 2021, mainly reflecting the strengthening US dollar.

I'd like to say a few words about the situation we are unfortunately experiencing with one of our customers, Qatar Airways. We had to make the decision to exercise our rights and terminate two A350-1000 delivery slots in the A321 contracts. These decisions followed many attempts to find mutually beneficial solutions and we continue to hope for an amicable solution. And I'd like to say as well that for us at Airbus the relationship with our customers is of the utmost importance, and we will continue to work hard to serve them.

Looking at Helicopters, in 2021, we achieved a record year of booking with book-to-bill well above one, which confirms the positive momentum for campaigns in our home countries as well as the good performance of our support and services business. Also in the year, we booked a total of 414 net orders compared to 268 in 2020. This includes 52 H160 helicopters, of which confirmed order by the French DGA for 30 units of the H160 military version as a first batch of the Light Joint Helicopter program, which plans for an overall total of 169 units. In addition, we recorded in Q4 an order for 36 H135 helicopters by the Spanish Ministry of Defense and Interior.

Finally, in Defence and Space, in 2021, our order intake was at €13.7 billion, up 15% year-on-year, corresponding to a book-to-bill of around 1.3. This commercial performance includes key orders in our Military Aircraft business such as two major contracts for the in-service support of the German and Spanish Eurofighter fleet; the Indian order for 56 C295 to replace the Air Force legacy fleet; MRTT related orders from the United Arab Emirates, the UAE and Spain, as well as the export contract with the Republic of Kazakhstan for two A400.

In our Space Systems business, we are going through the contract to design and manufacture six Galileo second-generation satellites. And in 2021, we launched 10 spacecraft in the OneWebs constellation deployment reached 394 satellites, so close to 400. We received orders for 12 more spacecraft and importantly, 20 of our satellites are now involved in climate change monitoring with 20 more in development.

For Eurodrone, we welcome the recent budgetary approval by Spain following that of France, Germany and Italy. Eurodrone will be the first project to be from the start, designed and developed through our new digital design manufacturing and service concepts. On FCAS, we continue to work with our industrial partners with the objective to move on to the next development phase later in the year.

Now, Dominik will take you through our financials.

Dominik Asam

Thank you, Guillaume, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Our fiscal year 2021 revenues increased to €52.1 billion, up 4% year-on-year, mainly reflecting the higher number of commercial aircraft deliveries, partially offset by a weakening average US dollar exchange rate. Our fiscal year EBIT adjusted increased to €4.9 billion, up from €1.7 billion in 2020, which included €1.1 billion of charges due to the impairments and write-offs triggered by COVID-19.

The strong yearly improvement of our EBIT adjusted is mainly driven by the commercial aircraft delivery performance and our efforts on cost containment and competitiveness. It also reflects the reduction of risk exposure which enabled us to leave some provisions. In particular, we reviewed the COVID-19 related charges and reassessed the level of exposure, which had a positive impact on our EBIT adjusted mainly in the second half of the year.

On research and development, our expenses in 2021 stood at €2.7 billion, slightly below the 2020 level. The R&D expenses are expected to increase to around €2.9 billion in 2022. Our fiscal year earnings per share adjusted stood at €4.33 per share, based on an average of 785 million shares outstanding.

Our fiscal year free cash flow before M&A and customer financing was €3.5 billion. It reflects our efforts in cash containment and a decrease in working capital, mainly driven by inventory improvement. It also includes the divestment of one of our sites in France.

All-in-all, we saw a very strong performance in ’21 while we're still managing our costs in a crisis mode in the first half of the year, and benefited from provision releases mainly in H2, we progressively resumed activities to prepare our future and this will further accelerate in 2022. This mainly includes additional investments in research and development, digitalization and cyber security and efforts to support the single-aisle ramp up.

Now on to the next slide regarding our profitability. Fiscal Year ’21 EBIT reported was €5.3 billion. The level of EBIT adjustments total a net positive of €0.5. billion including plus €274 million related to the A380 program, of which €84 million were booked in Q4; plus €122 million gain on disposal from the sale of the aforementioned site in France recorded in Q4; minus €212 million related to A400M, of which minus €209 million in Q4; minus 38 million negative impact from foreign exchange and balance sheet relation of which plus €127 million in Q4; and €331 million from other adjustments, mainly including around €4.2 billion of provision relief that’s related to the restructuring plan and payments by suppliers, plus €45 million were booked in Q4.

Earnings per share reported include minus €15 million of financial results. It mainly reflects minus €246 million of net interest result as well as the revaluation of financial instruments and of certain equity investments. The tax rate on the core business is around 27%. The effective tax rates on net income is 17%, including the positive effect from tax risk updates and the tax effect on the revaluation of certain equity investments, as well as a net release of deferred tax assets impairments, mainly due to an updated business outlook. All this result in a record net income of €4.2 billion with earnings per share reported of €5.36.

Regarding our hedging activities in fiscal year ’21, $20.9 billion of the hedges matured with associated EBIT impact at the rate of $1.20 versus $1.19 in the prior year. During the year, we adjusted the phasing of our hedges by implementing around $5 billion of rollovers, mainly in Q1. We also implemented $29.5 billion of forward at a rate of $1.21 of which $6.7 billion in Q4 at a rate of $1.18, mainly for the years 2022 to 2025. As a result, our total hedging portfolio in US dollar including $1.2 billion of hedges disqualified in Q1 ’21 stands at $88.3 billion, with an average exchange rate of $1.25 versus $1.26 in December 2020.

Now let's look at our cash evolution in ’21. Our gross cash flow from operations of €4.5 billion mainly reflects our EBIT adjusted and includes a €4.6 billion provision consumption related to the restructuring plan. Our working capital has decreased by €1 billion. It mainly reflects the reduction in inventory with the deliveries of the last A380s and the continued optimization of our wide-body inventories largely offset by contract assets and liabilities.

Year-to-date the A400M continue to weigh on our free cash flow before M&A but less so than in 2020. 2021 CapEx was around minus €1.9 billion, slightly higher than in 2020. We expect our CapEx to be around minus €2.4 billion in 2022. Free cash free cash flow reported was €3.5 billion. M&A activities accounted only for minus €32 million, whereas customer financing represented an inflow of €28 million.

The aircraft financing environment in 2021 remained solid with sufficient liquidity in financial markets for our product. We also benefited from the support of export credit agencies. Going forward, a low level of customer financing may not be sustainable, and we anticipate some usage of cash in the coming years.

Our net cash position has improved to €7.6 billion as of the end of December and our liquidity position remained strong and stood at €28.7 billion. As mentioned during our last quarterly disclosure, we've extended the maturity of our €6 billion revolving syndicated credit facility by one year in Q4. Going forward, we will continue to adopt an active approach when it comes to managing our liquidity with the objective of maintaining our robust credit rating.

So, back to Guillaume.

Guillaume Faury

Thank you, Dominik. Now onto commercial aircraft, and in 2021, we delivered 611 aircraft to 88 customers of which two operating lease without revenue recognition at delivery. This delivery performance represents a year-on-year increase of 45 aircraft.

In 2021, we also provided additional visibility to our suppliers and in particular we secured the production rate for the A320 family up to summer 2023, which is mid of next year. In addition, we continue the development of our product portfolio with the launch of the A350 freighter, and the progress on the A321 XLR.

Let's now look at the more detailed situation by aircraft family. On the A220, we delivered 50 aircraft. We continue to ramp up and are on track for rate 14 that we envisage by the middle of the decade. The prefile in Mirabel is now operational and will support this ramp up. On A320, we deliver on the 483 aircraft of which 221 A321. We continue to deliver on our production ramp up and we are on the trajectory to achieve rate of 65 by summer 2023.

We continue to derisk the ramp up including by enabling all of our assembly sites to become A321 ready. For production rates beyond 2023, we are still in the assessment phase, and we are working with our suppliers to potentially enable an increase above rate 65. On the A321XLR, the first of the development aircraft to enter the FAL in Hamburg in November, this aircraft will perform the flight testing and type certification program starting this year to pave the way for service production and entry into service next year, 2023.

On A330, we delivered 18 aircraft of which the MRTT. The A330-800 received its 251 ton Max-Take-Off Weight certification in December. And as previously announced, we target to increase our monthly production rate to almost three aircraft at the end of 2022. On the A350, 55 aircraft were delivered. We continue to expect to increase the A350 production rate from around five per month to around six in early 2023. On the A380, we delivered around five aircraft in 2021, of which the last produced A380 to Emirates. The A380 will continue to fly without support for many, many years.

Let's now look at Airbus commercial financials for the year. Revenues increase by 6% year-on-year, mainly reflecting the higher deliveries as compared to 2020. The increase in EBIT adjusted is mainly driven by the delivery performance, our efforts on cost containment and competitiveness. In addition, we released some provisions reflecting among others, the good progress made on the remarketing of unplaced aircrafts, as we did in [Hungary].

Finally, let me remind you that our full year 2020 EBIT adjusted, included €1.1 billion of charges due to impairments and write-offs triggered by COVID-19. Looking at Helicopters, in 2021, we delivered 338 helicopters, which is 38 more than in 2020 and it includes the first H160 delivery. Revenues increased by 4% year-on-year up to €6.5 billion reflecting growth in services and higher delivery.

EBIT adjusted increased by around 14% year-on-year to €535 million, mainly driven by support and services program execution and cost focus. As a result, the profit margin stood in 2021 at 8.2% compared to 7.5% in 2020.

And let's complete our review of 2021 with Defence and Space. Revenues are slightly lower compared to 2020, mainly driven by Military Aircraft, partially offset by space systems. The increase in EBIT adjusted reflects cost containment continuation. As a reminder, the performance of 2020 was impacted by the COVID-19 on new [DOF] projects.

On the A400M, we delivered eight aircrafts in 2021. We've continued with development activities towards achieving the revised capacity roadmap. Retrofit activities are progressing in close alignment with the customer. In the fourth quarter, we recorded the charge of €4.2 million, mainly reflecting the updated estimates of delivery pattern of the launch contract and the associated impact on unabsorbed cost.

Risk remain on the development of technical capabilities and associated costs on aircraft operational reliability, in particular with regard to power plants on cost reductions, and on securing export orders in time, as per the revised baseline.

Now, let's move to 2022. And let me read our 2022 guidance for you. As the basis for 2022 guidance, the company assumes no further disruptions to the world economy, air traffic, the company's internal operations, and its ability to deliver products and services. The company's 2022 guidance is before M&A. On that basis, the company targets to achieve in 2022 around 720 commercial aircraft deliveries, EBIT adjusted of €5.5 billion and free cash flow before M&A and customer financing of €3.5 billion. This guidance reflects our expected growth trajectory and the investments we are making to prepare our future in the future of aviation.

And now a few words to wrap up and address key priorities. In 2021, we delivered on our commitments. We intend to do so again this year while, as I said, we lay the foundations for our future. We will remain focused on managing our contract and delivery. And as we speak, we have to adapt to the effects of Omicron. We will also focus on further strengthening our backlog across businesses.

Ramping up our A320 family production will be at the heart of our priorities. We continue to work closely with our suppliers to execute our plans. We also announced a global plan to recruit around 6000 new employees across the entire group to support both the ramp up and the company long term project and ambitions. The production ramp up will also be supported by our investment in upgrading and transforming the industrial value chain.

We achieved major steps early in the year. We launched, there was a launch of our new wholly owned subsidiary Airbus Atlantic in France and the agreement with our social partners in Germany to establish a fully integrated similar aerostructure assembly company, which will be operational on the first of July this year, 1st of July 2022.

Looking forward, let me mention our future A321 final assembly line in Toulouse which will fully benefit from our latest progress in digitalization and robotics. The transformation of our company, including a continuing focus on operational excellence across the globe is key to prepare the future of aviation. This brings me to our long term ambition to lead the development of sustainable aerospace, which remains at the center of what we do and who we are as a company.

We have all seen how aerospace plays a critical role in society over the last years, connecting people and culture and driving prosperity, which will ensure the availability of the levels of investments required to meet the world's ambitious climate targets. Making our sector carbon free is essential to ensure aerospace can continue to play this vital role.

The decarbonisation of air travel is a key pillar of Airbus’ sustainability strategy. And this strategy was given a renewed impetus last year with the commitment of the entire sector to reach Net Zero Emissions by 2050. This was enforced by the recent so called Toulouse Declaration signed earlier this month by the 27 EU member states.

At Airbus, we'll continue to invest and to grow our skills and know how in order to meet this objective, by maturing the enabling technology bricks, and continuing to work on reducing our own emissions as a company.

Furthermore, our industry will ensure we benefit from peace, stability and security, without which sustainability can simply not exist. As such, we remain proud to see our Defence and Security solutions contributing to a safe and united world.

Finally, and before taking your questions, let me reiterate that delivering on our guidance will remain one of our top priorities in 2022. Strong financial results will secure our ability to invest in our long term ambitions across our portfolio.

And now, we are ready to take your questions. Thank you.

Helene Le Gorgeu

We now start our Q&A time. [Instructions] So Christine, please go ahead and explain the procedure for the participants.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator’s Instruction] First question is from Madame Celine Fornaro from UBS. Madame, please go ahead.

Céline Fornaro

[indiscernible] everyone. Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. And so first of all, well done on the 2021 results and also it's good to see some of the non-Airbus divisions having the record margins, I would say. And on that, my first question would be for the Defence performance, towards the last quarter of the year. If you could just explain maybe a little bit the dynamics there and how sustainable that performance is? And similarly for Helicopters when we're thinking about 2022, but also maybe the midterm? And then my second question would be regarding your delivery outlook for 720 deliveries. If you could also, maybe try to explain to us how you're thinking about the inventory levels, that you're ready to take towards this year compared to the levels that you've ended around in 2021, which was around 100 and what level do you think you will see towards the end of the year? Thank you.

Dominik Asam

Okay, thank you, Celine. Maybe I can take these questions. So on the performance of our divisions, the Defence and Space and Helico, they're normally this year, again, notoriously back-end loaded. So I would not recommend extrapolating from the Q4 performance into the future. I think what we can say is that we don't expect much change in the profitability in the coming year. We see some opportunities to gradually, over a five year planning horizon, move the margin slightly up.

On the question of deliveries, 720 and how that would correlate with the inventories? First of all, yes, you're right. We mentioned that we had close to 100 aircrafts, which were finished, or quasi-finished and not delivered in the last year, year 2020. End of ’21, we were slightly down. So a couple of handful, I would say, very much wide-bodies, which we could place. You recall, we had some unplaced aircraft, and we were successful in placing them. Not all of them have been placed, so we'll see further progress. Sorry, all of them have been placed and not delivered, so now we will see in ’23, ’24, that they will be delivered. So that will reduce and we will also see a slight reduction on single-aisle but still, let's not forget the situation is very dynamic. So we have to have to match the specific granular customer demand with our manufacturing. And that will in that turbulent period still mean a certain high level of that inventory, which over time as things normalize, can be worked down because pre-crisis, yes, we were lower with this single-aisle inventories at year end.

Céline Fornaro

And so just a quick follow up on that, Dominik, when would you expect normalization of the inventory level? Towards 2023 or you think that would be too early?

Dominik Asam

I think it could take a little bit longer but a gradual decrease. And again, we're not talking about huge numbers, we talked about a mid-double digit potential there in terms of deliveries over the next two, three years, I'd say.

Céline Fornaro

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you, madam. The next question is from Mr. Tristan Sanson from BNP Paribas Exane. Please go ahead.

Guillaume Faury

Yeah, now it’s okay.

Tristan Sanson

I'm sorry. Can you hear me?

Guillaume Faury

Yes, it’s okay, now.

Tristan Sanson

Apologies for that. And so it's Tristan Sanson from BNP Paribas. So first question, please can you give us a few hints of where you see the bottlenecks, the main bottlenecks that you need to monitor in the management of deliveries in 2022? Is it at the delivery center? Is it on the supplier side? Is it HR related? That will be quite helpful. And maybe a question for Dominik, if you could give us some elements of the main moving parts of the Bridge for ’22? You provided some helpful comments of about €150 million of costs increase from R&D. What are the other big moving parts that we should be aware of for ’22, in essence?

Guillaume Faury

Yes, maybe I take the first one. Hello, Tristan. Well, the bottleneck at the moment and most probably for the whole year is on the supply chain. And with a large diversity of situations, what are the root causes of those bottlenecks at the supply chain? Well, that's just basically, I think, been either for a while with COVID-19, having to ramp up again in a very complex environments of high prices and scarcity of raw material, difficulties to -- with logistics around the world, and incredible prices, by the way. Energy situation is complex, and a number of places around the world and around [overseas] where it's really difficult to find the resources again. But at Airbus, we don’t have too much of this HR challenge this year in 2022. We think 2022 will be okay. Moving forward, this will continue to remain a point of attention.

Dominik Asam

Maybe on the bridge from the extra the €4.9 billion EBIT adjusted in ’21 to the €5.5 billion we’ve guided for ’22. So, you mentioned already the R&D increment. So you're stepping up the R&D effort to €2.9 billion with a couple €100 million round about. We will also resuscitate and accelerate on our digital roadmap, including the famous DDMS project, which is paramount to our future success and competitiveness. And we'll reduce time-to-market. That’s another €0.2 billion-ish. And last but not least, we'll also invest more than in the prior year in the ramp up securitization because of these challenges you were mentioning. So all together that kind of investment in the future, as we call it, and again it's technically not investment, it’s expenses is €0.5 billion round about.

If I add the kind of protection we take on inflation risks and the €0.02 of dollar depreciation, that's another €0.5 billion. So take that together, you have €1 billion. And then don’t forget, there is a kind of non-repetition of these releases of provisions, which are about €0.4 billion. So if you take all that together, you see that for the incremental aircraft deliveries and don't forget in the increment, there are also A220s, which don't add margin. We actually do a pretty good job to bring the incremental deliveries to a healthy contribution margin, additionally. Including the mix effects, we had 46% A321 deliveries in 2021 and you see the backlog disclosed is now at 59% A321. So that will also help to add the margin from the incremental delivery. So that's how you can kind of easily walk from ’21 into ’22.

Tristan Sanson

That's good. Kind of makes sense, Dominik, thank you.

Operator

Thank you, sir. Next question is from Mr. Benjamin Heelan from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Sir, please go ahead.

Benjamin Heelan

Yeah. Morning, guys. Thanks for the question. And so I've got a question first on the production rates for the 320. You said you're still in the assessment phase for beyond ’23. When do you anticipate that you can make some decisions here? And what do you see as the hurdles to this? Is it demand? Is it supply chain? I think you've just talked about supply chain, so any incremental color there would be great. And then my second question is on the kind of more medium term, I think in your key priorities, you highlight that you're focused on cash and earnings growth beyond ’22. How should we think about the margin potential of this business medium-term and any potential for a Capital Markets Day at some point? Thank you.

Guillaume Faury

We’ll let the question two and three to Dominik. And hello, Ben. Good speaking to you. Production rates, well that's front and center, for the first half of this year. We want to be in a position to decide by mid of the year. And this would be the right timing for decision for ’24, ’25. So that's why we're targeting mid of the year. And it will be all about the balance between demand and the demand is very strong. It could go quite high, actually, if we would just look at the demand, but we have to balance it with the supply and the supply capacities. And as I said before, the result of the assessments of the whole supply chain and its capacity and willingness to go to higher rates and we need to look at it over time. We need have sustainability of the rates, we will consider for beyond the mid of 2023. So the short answer is, by mid of this year, we want to have concluded on what we do for ’24, ’25 and beyond. Dominik, the two other ones?

Dominik Asam

So, on the margin prospect, I mean, now we've guided ’22, so I think you have quite solid data points to start extrapolating a little bit from ’21, ’22 and into the coming years. Yeah, it's clear that there are certain opportunities we have because the year ’23 is still burdened by a lot of activities. I mean, there is the introduction of the XLR, which is of course only giving us the harvesting in ’24, ’25 timeframe. And freighter enter into service in ’25, well we have now all the burden of the investment, and then we’ll benefit. And yet on the R&D and we’re also stepping up DDMS, the project I just mentioned is kind of highest spent rate in these years ’23, ’24. So there is opportunities to expand the margin. I mentioned the mix, the positive mix that we have 59% of FY21 in the backlog.

Now, the reason why we don't want to give a specific guidance and say middle of the decade, is that we have a couple of inbound abilities which are still quite speculative. So what's the wide-body pricing on the open slots in that timeframe? We have the big question about inflation now. What does it really mean in the short term? And as I mentioned, we can handle it quite well but in the longer term, it might cause an issue. And then there's always the question of R&D invest, what's the product policy? What reaction is needed towards what the competitor is doing? So that's out of our control and all these topics together make us cautious in terms of really giving you a precise number. But yes, they are ingredients which give us hope that there is potential to go to higher margins beyond ’22, ’23.

Benjamin Heelan

Okay, and Capital Market Day at some point, is that something that you've thought about?

Dominik Asam

I’ll let Guillaume to comment.

Guillaume Faury

Let’s just stay [on the beach].

Dominik Asam

Not fair. I would like to do more, let's put it that way. But again, I mean, it's more that we regularly have done it in the past. Don't expect any miracles on that day. I think one topic we want to really, really work on is on also the ESG related topics. There's always a debate about Defence, which is currently heating up. I think we need to invest some time with our investors, so I am looking for opportunities to do that, yes.

Benjamin Heelan

Cool. Thank you, guys.

Operator

Thank you, sir. Next question is from Mr. David Perry from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.

David Perry

Yes, good morning Guillaume and Dominik. So my two questions, the first one, yesterday afternoon some headlines popped up on Reuters about Airbus undertaking a review of its defence activities. So maybe Guillaume, you could make some comments on that if there is anything to say? The other one is also some press reports a few days ago of the threat of a strike in the UK. I believe it's about policy on pay. So just more broadly, and in this high inflation world, what will your policy be on paying? And can you just remind us how much of it will be covered? Any pay increases are covered by the escalation clauses? Thank you.

Guillaume Faury

So I will take those questions, thank you. I think the first one is, you're referring to the paper on the defence review at Airbus. Well there is no news here, we are conducting strategic reviews with the Board on our defence business lines every year and that's something, I believe, we'll continue to do. And I think that's what the paper was about. So there's nothing I can comment on that topic. Strike in the UK? Well, let me take maybe a step back. We had two very difficult years. I think Airbus employees have really done a great job. As you have seen, we have decided to put the dividend, again, in place. And that's about moving forward now and finding the right balance between the different stakes, the short term, the mid-term, the long term. And I respect the fact that employees want to have a fair share of the results that they have contributed to create. So we need to find a solution case by case. You might remember we had a situation to manage -- a similar situation to manage in Germany. By end of last year, we resolved the situation by negotiation. We have a culture in the company to find solution and to work together for the good of the company. And I guess that's what we will do again in that case.

Moving forward and Dominik made some comments about it. There are a number of areas of uncertainty. We think we will continue to perform but we need to be all together finding those right trade-offs to make sure this will continue to be the case. And that's the kind of discussion we are used to have with our unions and social representatives and employees. And that's what we're going to do in the UK as well.

David Perry

Okay, thank you. Thank you and maybe just to clarify. If there are pay increases, I mean what is allowable in the escalation clauses in the contract with the customs?

Guillaume Faury

Well there are pay increases given the environment we're in and given the fact that we were very prudent in 2020 and 2021. So it's clear that there will be increases in the pay. And the contracts are taking reference to indexes, which are by far more general data points. And there is no direct correlation between what we do on salary in one country or one division, and where the contracts are protecting us on inflation, in the way escalation is managed. So we have an overall protection from the contracts and then we have to manage our costs. And by the way, all cost to make sure these remain quite balanced and in a situation where inflation is putting up very quickly and to very high number, that's quite of a challenge. And that's what Dominik tried to explain before.

David Perry

Okay, thank you very much.

Guillaume Faury

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you, sir. Next question is from Mr. Neil Glynn from Credit Suisse. Sir, go ahead.

Neil Glynn

Well, good morning, everybody. I’ll ask two questions, please. The first one following on from the previous comment on R&D over the medium term, I appreciate there are moving parts here. But reflected in your take as to whether the R&D level will eventually step up from the €2.9 million in 2022, towards a 2019 level of €3.4 million or something like that? Keen to understand how you think about that progression and recovery? Then the second question, you mentioned a low level of customer financing not sustainable and obviously, that's been very, very low for some time. Could you give us some additional color as to whether it's the issue changing your, I guess, necessarily approach to that activity is driven by pockets of weakness, for example, in Southeast Asia? Or are there any other changes, you're observing in the appetite from financiers of interest rates rise that may prompt you to have to step into the bridge? Thank you.

Dominik Asam

Yeah, so on R&D, yes, I think as a trend we see R&D scaling a little bit with the deliveries going up and I think your assessment is a reasonable starting point. But once we get back to what we've seen in 2019, we might be at a similar level of R&D. So there's nothing I can say that could make that come implausible. But as I said, also, we need to review year-by-year what we exactly do there. On the customer financing, what we wanted to highlight is that we have been really going down and reducing that exposure to close to nothing. We do have certain obligations going forward like buybacks. You've heard some stories on A380 buybacks. Some financing would be required. We don't see that the market itself will weaken. I mean, obviously, we have to monitor the interest rate environment. Should there be a massive increase in interest rate, that might have a negative impact but on the other hand, that has positive impacts. But at Airbus, recall we have a net cash position, we have a pension liability, which would benefit from higher interest rates. And so these are the things that we look at. I just wanted to highlight that the fact that we reduced our vendor financing portfolio every year. It’s not something we can continue because simply it's close to zero, and that there are some obligations we need to fulfill going forward.

Neil Glynn

Understood and many thanks.

Operator

Thank you, sir. Next question is from Madame Milene Kerner from Barclays. Madame, please go ahead.

Milene Kerner

Yes, and Guillaume, Dominik, Helene, and everyone, thank you for taking my question. I have two related to the free cash flow. First Dominik, you mentioned that the A400M cash outs was lower in 2021 than it was in 2020. Could you comment what you expect for 2022 and the total amount that is left to cash out over what timeframe? And then secondly, also can you help us, how should we think about the PDP inflow from now on as you're going to ramp your production on the A320? Thank you.

Dominik Asam

Milene, on that question of A400M, I would like to add also the A220 because these are the two big blocks which has caused a kind of negative bridge from catering cash conversion. So from the earnings down to the free cash flow and the guidance I'm going to give you is that for this year ’22, I think that the sum of the two will a headwind in that cash conversion calculation of about half a billion, I don't want to single out any of the two but that's just a rough order of magnitude. There is a little bit of headwind left from provision payouts for restructuring and from the compliance case where we will need to spend some money. And this is explaining why we go from the €5.5 billion EBIT adjusted down to a €3.5 billion free cash flow. So it also shows you that if you adjust for these two effects I mentioned, we actually are on a super trajectory to convert a bit into cash advance there. So it's actually quite solid for ’22 if you think about these headwinds which as you know will stop overtime or reduce overtime.

PDP flows, you have heard us comment on this deferral discussion that we basically were clinging on to PDP’s in the COVID times have been deferring aircraft. You've seen that this has cost us quite some cash flow in ’21 and you have already disclosed the full cash flow statements. So you see what's happening there. And it was less pronounced than what we thought because we had actually a very good commercial activity, we're collecting a lot of PDPs in ’21. And that combination of seeing less of that hangover of the COVID kind of issue plus picking up in commercial activities should bode well for actually the cash conversion and you should -- we should not see a repetition of such a negative PDP inflow in ’22.

Milene Kerner

Thank you, very clear. Thanks.

Operator

Thank you, Madame. Next question is from Christophe Menard from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Christophe Menard

Yes, good morning. I had two quick questions. Could you comment please, on the supply chain constraint, raw material and logistic costs? And have you seen any worsening of the situation? I mean, following your comments in January, essentially, and I’ll follow up on the second question, afterwards.

Guillaume Faury

No, I would not see think there was significant modifications. Since January, that means the same environment, nothing significantly different.

Christophe Menard

And nothing on continuum, for instance and still, you're not seeing any additional constraint on that specific raw material.

Guillaume Faury

No.

Christophe Menard

And the second question was on the 2024/2025 production levels, is -- I mean, we understand it's a supply issue with suppliers. Is it also tied to their capacity to deliver some cost reduction, i.e. is your decision linked to or fostered by their ability to cut the cost or is it just I mean, to ensure the supply of parts?

Guillaume Faury

We are having discussions on rates and on cost at the same time with suppliers. But I guess the outcome of the decision will be mainly the result of the ability of the supply chain to do that ramp up. And I think the certainty on the demand side that there is enough sustainability in the demand to make sure that once we have ramped up, we can stay at the higher level of ramp up. We don't want to ramp up at the peak and ramp down immediately. That would be meaningless for most of us. So that's the complex balance of the different stakes. And that's why it takes time and when we get there, we have to stick to what we will have decided. So balance between demand and supply and the ability to keep that level of activity for a while.

Christophe Menard

Okay, thank you very much.

Operator

Thank you, sir. Next question is for Mr. Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Please, go ahead.

Robert Stallard

Thanks, so much. Good morning.

Dominik Asam

Good morning.

Guillaume Faury

Hi, good morning.

Robert Stallard

A couple of questions. Thank you. a couple of questions from me. First of all, Guillaume, on the whole Qatar issue, has this had any negative ramifications on the broader A350 demand environment, and sort of if you could comment on that? And then Dominik for you, you've given us quite a few components on the 2022 cash guidance, whereas only if you could give us some idea of your assumptions on what working capital is going to be doing? Thank you.

Guillaume Faury

I’ll take the first question. No, I don't see any impact on the broader A350 situation. And as you have seen, we are quite successful on the launch of the A350 freighter. The commercial launch is now and a number of customers are being signed up committed to the A350 freighter in the last month. So no, I don't see any ramification so far.

Robert Stallard

Okay, so and on working capital. I mean, I already hinted to some of the topics. The first big thing is always the kind of net PDP flows, which you find under contract assets and liabilities in the cash flow statement, which was a negative €2.3 billion in 2001. And I mentioned that this will come to an end because we will start collecting better PDPs. So I'm anticipating that this is really turning neutral if not slightly positive. And on inventories, yes, while on the one hand, we can still divest some of the finished goods and get cash out of them, there is a big, heavy lifting happening on the single-aisle ramp. So I see that more as on a trend as a headwind on working capital. And then there's some other accruals where, for instance, we had a very strong target achievement in ’21 and now this needs to be paid in ’22. So these are the hints I can give you but overall, if you pool it all together, and embark the big items like A400M and the A220 headwind because of loss making contract provisions, which are used to offset the cash burn and give you a neutral EBIT on cash burn, €3.5 billion is what kind of impacts all of that.

Robert Stallard

That's very helpful. Thank you.

Operator

Thank you, sir. Next question is for Mr. Andrew Humphrey from Morgan Stanley. Sir, go ahead.

Andrew Humphrey

Good morning, and thank you. Could I come back to Defence and David’s question earlier. I’ve got a couple on that, if I may? Would it be fair to assume that this year's review of Defense activities and strategy is focused on or primarily on FCAS? And yeah, what are the scenarios you're considering in relation to that? And the second question is, what are the areas where you perceive a most pressing or acute need for strategic partnership in Defence?

Dominik Asam

So, FCAS is obviously an important part of the Defence review, but the strategy is not FCAS. It’s one brick of the strategy and we are already in partnership in many areas in Defence, that's very much the nature of the Defence business, especially in Europe. And I will not comment on what we consider or we should be doing for the future. That's part of the strategic review and that's not something that we comment on.

Andrew Humphrey

Okay, thank you.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Harry Breach from Stifel. Please go ahead.

Harry Breach

Yes, and can you hear me?

Guillaume Faury

Yes, loud and clear.

Harry Breach

Yes, thank you. Good morning Guillaume, good morning Dominik. Thank you for taking my question. Just two from me. First maybe A400M revision to the delivery schedule, small charge that you announced today, can you can you give us any understanding in light of when we can get to stable production rates, stable cost at completion and the order backlog or the order intake we’ll need to get there? And second one, maybe more generally on the sales campaign activity. We had a very strong end to last year. I think that the Dubai Air Show commercial success you had there, you know, certainly surprised me very strongly. Can you give us some sense about the level of sales campaign activity at the moment? Is it, would you still characterize it as being strong. Is it strong and getting stronger about the same? Any hesitation caused by Omicron? Any feeling for that will be great.

Guillaume Faury

Maybe I'll start, again, speaking about the second one. Yes, the end of the year was very strong in terms of bookings. And it was also a bit of a surprise for me compared to what we were expecting a year ago. But indeed, it represents an acceleration that is steady, beginning of this year. And it's very much in line with what I said, with the airlines being now very active to look into the future, becoming by far more optimistic, looking beyond Omicron for sure on the domestic markets, but as well for international flights and long distance flights. So I would consider it as a trend, as a solid trend. And always remain very prudent when it comes to forecasting the future. But yes, it's very active at the moment and we see as well that the Singapore Air Show is a bit of that nature. So I take it as something that is that is rather positive, moving forward. Dominik, you want to take the other one?

Dominik Asam

On A400M, I mean, you mentioned the chart we've taken in Q4, yes, it was charged. But I would also like to mention that if you compare how we've kind of reduced these charges or what time, we're really kind of converging and stabilizing, that program is a very tricky program. So you can never kind of be entirely sure but we think the worst is behind us. And on top of that, we had some export success. And the assumptions, we have embarked in our provisions in loss making contract provisions on the program, such that we feel confident that we should be on the right trajectory. And so all what we can see today is that we are not anticipating huge charges going forward and that the trend is [indiscernible] actually on that topic.

Harry Breach

Dominik, you spoke earlier on about the about the level of cash burn on A400M. I think together with the A220, I think you talked about around a half billion number. Where -- when do we, what sort of run rate level should we think about maybe in next year in 2023, or 2024, for those two programs, and do they get to breakeven in cash out in any year?

Dominik Asam

First, I have to highlight, we're not talking about the cash burn directly here. What I mentioned is the offset between earnings and cash. That's different, because we will also have some losses on A220. So there's higher cash burn than what is embarked in that €500 million-ish for both of them. I mean, I mentioned we had half a billion round about last year for the year prior, it was lower this year. So we're trending down, we're trending towards kind of, I'd say low triple-digit numbers over the coming years, every year. But it should also be over the next couple, two to three years. So we're not talking about massive cash out on the A400M. It's stabilizing and trending down to levels which are clearly below the half billion or so, we've seen in the prior years.

Harry Breach

Great. Thank you. Thank you, both.

Dominik Asam

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you, sir. Last question is for Mr. Jeremy Bragg from Redburn. Please go ahead.

Jeremy Bragg

Good morning. So my first question please would be to you Guillaume, and it would be, how competent do you feel? What's the level of visibility on the 720 deliveries in 2022? Do you see this as a realistic number or potentially a floor? And then the second question, please, is a medium-term one on capital allocation. You've restarted the dividend. What level of net cash buffer do you think you need medium-term? Is that still around €10 billion? And how are you thinking about capital allocation in the medium term because you're quite quickly going to get to €10 billion of net cash? Thank you.

Guillaume Faury

Thank you, Jeremy. The second question is obviously too difficult for me, so I will handover to you Dominik, sorry for that. And visibility on the 720, well, we guided for 2021, 600. If you look at the 720, it’s plus 20%. Actually we did the 611 which I consider a very strong result compared to the 600, so it just gives you an indication that 720, the balance. And we think it's not going to be easy but we think we can definitely do it, that's why we guide on it. Significantly more is, in my view, extremely difficult. So I would not bet, if I were you, on significantly more than 720. It's a challenge and we need to earn our right to hitch this 720, every month, every week and maybe every day. It's a difficult on that. Now, the more the more difficult one, Dominik?

Dominik Asam

Well, it's actually not that difficult, because we, again reiterate what we said before. €10 billion net cash seems to us to be a reasonable target. Don't forget, our net cash definition is excluding the pension liability. The pension liability has benefited clearly from the increase in interest rates. So interest rates have moved up and the pension liability is now reduced to more than €7 billion. We used to be €10 billion plus now it is €7 billion plus. And we will need to close that gap over time. Obviously, how much cash will be used for that is very much dependent on further development of interest rates. So that's why it's hard to predict and that will also be a question in the capital allocation. So yeah, yes, we work very hard to bring it up to €10 billion as quickly as possible. But there are some items we have to take care of before we can think about measures beyond the dividend. And obviously also, with the earnings growing, we also want to see the dividend evolving accordingly.

Jeremy Bragg

Thank you. And you mentioned a compliance charge this year. Could you just remind me what that was?

Dominik Asam

No. I mean, we have previously told you that there is still some provisions that will need to be settled, so to speak. And it's not about taking more provisions, it's about paying these provisions.

Jeremy Bragg

Right.

Dominik Asam

But I think the good news is that I think we, at some point in time said it could be as high as the mid-to-high triple digit million. I think I'm a little bit more optimistic today of what’s left to be paid.

Jeremy Bragg

Okay, thank you. Thanks very much.

Dominik Asam

Thank you.

Company Overview

Eastman Chemical Company (EMN) is a U.S.-based industrial company that manufactures a wide range of commodity and specialty plastics, chemicals and fibers. It was spun off from Eastman Kodak in 1994. As a company which sells most of its products to manufacturers of end user-related products, EMN is a highly cyclical company. The company generates its sales all over the world, with a slight emphasis on the U.S. and Canada:

Own work, based on EMN's 2020 10-K

The company operations are managed and reported in four segments (pp. 9, 2020 annual report):

Additives & Functional Products manufactures materials for products related to the energy, transportation, consumables, building & construction, animal nutrition, crop protection and home care markets. Main end products are resins, preservatives, water treatments (e.g., flocculants and surfactants), aviation fuels and tire additives. The segment's focus lies on high-value additives that provide critical functionality while only comprising a small percentage of total customer product cost. Main competitors include Dow, Exxon Mobil, BASF, Celanese, Kolon Industries, Evonik, Perstorp, Huntsman, Corteva and Bayer.

The Advanced Materials segment is the company’s business unit responsible for the production of polymers, films, and plastics for value-added end-uses in, e.g., transportation, consumables, building and construction. As an example, the segment produces copolyesters that are used as BPA-free container surfaces. Also, the segment produces high performance coatings for solar heat rejection that maintain excellent optical properties. Through the segment's vertical integration, scale in manufacturing and long-term customer relationships, the company exhibits a competitive advantage. Main competitors include 3M, Saint-Gobain, Covestro, Evonik, Mitsubishi Chemical, Daicel Chemical Industries, Sekisui Chemical, Kuraray, Chang Chun and XPEL.

EMN’s Chemical Intermediates segment includes cellulose and acetyl, olefins, and alkylamines manufacturing facilities that are also vertically integrated. The segment sells excess intermediates beyond the company’s internal specialty needs and benefits from its competitive cost positions primarily resulting from the access to lower cost raw materials. Management expects the segment to continue to benefit from the growth in relative use of non-phthalate plasticizers in the western world. Main competitors include the aforementioned companies but also LyondellBasell, Lonza, US Amines and LG Chem.

The Fibers segment manufactures acetate tow and triacetin plasticizers. Of note, EMN is one of the world’s two largest suppliers of acetate tow and has been a market leader in its manufacture and sale since the early 1950s. Also, it is the world's largest producer of acetate yarn. Due to its market leading position and its long-standing experience, EMN has a competitive advantage in this field as well.

Performance of the Business

Since 2015, EMN grew its top-line at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.4%. The cyclical nature of the business is underscored by a decline in sales of 9% in 2020. The company's exposure to commodity-related products results in a rather low overall gross margin, which is nonetheless very respectable by industry standards. Between 2015 and 2020, gross margin declined from 26.7% to 23.3% but rebounded in fiscal 2021 to 23.9% (see below), at times when other companies operating further down the value chain are having troubles passing on price increases to their customers. Sales rebounded nicely from the pandemic-induced low, underscoring the economic recovery. Nevertheless, the company remains highly cyclical and is partially dependent on the automotive industry, where it is currently feeling the effects of the shortage of OEM components (see Q4 2021 earnings presentation). Likewise, the performance of its construction-related businesses is impacted by continuing supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. EMN’s operating profitability also rebounded nicely from the 2020 dip but remains below its longer-term average profitability (see below). Overall, Eastman’s operating margin is pretty strong for a chemicals company. In comparison, Dow Inc. (DOW) is more dependent on commoditized products as is suggested by its five-year average operating margin of less than 10%. The same holds true for German competitor BASF (OTCQX:BASFY, BFFAF), with an average operating margin of 8%.

Own work, based on EMN's 2015 to 2020 10-Ks and the most recent earnings release

Eastman’s focus on adding value to otherwise commoditized products is also underlined by its – relatively speaking – strong return on invested capital (ROIC) and cash return on invested capital (CROIC), which is largely a function of the company’s typically robust free cash flow conversion (see below). Nevertheless, the company cannot necessarily be considered a net creator of shareholder value, as its profitability metrics hover around or are at times weaker than the estimated weighted average cost of capital ((OTCPK:WACC)) of 9.5%.

Understandably, profitability took a hit in 2020, in line with peers, but is already back to normal levels. Please note that my estimate for Eastman’s 2021 CROIC is likely higher than the values published elsewhere. This is attributed to the fact that the company booked significant (one-time) additions to working capital in 2021 that impacted operating cash flow and consequently also free cash flow, as it is typically computed. However, as my calculations rely on normalized free cash flow (see below), I accounted for this one-off and instead looked at the long-term average contribution of working capital accounts.

Own work, based on EMN's 2015 to 2020 10-Ks, the 2021 10-Q3 and the most recent earnings release

The cyclicality of EMN’s business is further underlined by fluctuating capital expenditures and movements in working capital accounts, which give rise to a rather volatile but nevertheless robust normalized free cash flow (nFCF). Comprehensibly, the company’s nFCF margin has been similarly volatile at 6.3% to 14.4% over the last seven years. Eastman’s nFCF conversion ratio, which is a measure of the company’s ability to convert net earnings into free cash flow, is typically very robust (i.e., at or above 100%) but was pretty low in 2017 (68%). This is attributed to a non-cash benefit related to a reversed tax provision ($394 million) which boosted net earnings. Besides Eastman's historic nFCF, its reconciliation is shown below as well. Changes in working capital typically amount to less than 1% of sales but were more pronounced in fiscal 2020 (a decrease in working capital of 2% of sales) due a material decrease in inventories ($ 291 million). Considering the various adjustments, a normalized FCF of $870 million appears appropriate for the purpose of valuation, as is outlined in the respective section of this article.

Balance Sheet Assessment

For cyclical companies, I prefer balance sheets with conservative debt and leverage ratios. Eastman’s debt-to-equity ratio was pretty high in 2015, at 2.9. However, the company deleveraged significantly and its debt-to-equity ratio is now as low as 1.6 (based on the 10-Q3 2021 balance sheet). Note that EMN carries a significant amount of goodwill on its balance sheet (i.e., $4.0 billion as of September 30, 2021), which translates to 65% of shareholder equity.

EMN’s net debt to EBITDA, as well as its net debt to nFCF have spiked in 2020 due to the pandemic-related decline in earnings and operating cash flow but have already reached very acceptable levels in fiscal 2021 (see below). Overall, debt appears to be well managed at Eastman Chemical.

Own work, based on EMN's 2015 to 2020 10-Ks, the 2021 10-Q3 and the most recent earnings release

The company’s interest coverage ratio in terms of pre-interest nFCF is somewhat weaker than I would like to see in a highly cyclical business. Historically, EMN has covered its interest expenses with nFCF by a factor of 4 but the ratio has increased to almost 6 in 2021, largely due to the strong OCF, the still quite modest capital expenditures but notably also due to the ongoing deleveraging. EMN’s total debt declined from $7.0 billion in 2015 to $5.5 billion in 2021. As a side note, the deleveraging is not attributable to sale-and-lease back transactions as is confirmed by the similarly declining operating lease liabilities ($273 million in 2015, $193 million in 2021). The company's maturity profile suggests that EMN will likely need to refinance most of its upcoming maturities at the less favorable interest rates currently anticipated.

Own work, based on EMN's 2020 10-K

Pension-related liabilities are material but certainly manageable at 6% of total assets. Even though such liabilities are interest-rate sensitive and subject to stock market gyrations, they have remained rather stable in absolute terms but have nevertheless decreased relative to total assets.

Overall, it can be concluded that Eastman’s balance sheet is reasonably robust for a cyclical company. Its interest coverage ratio is not particularly strong but I do not consider this overly concerning due to the ongoing deleveraging thanks to the company’s relatively stable free cash flow. Nevertheless, due to the material upcoming maturities and potentially increasing interest rates, Eastman is expected to spend an increasing portion of its operating profit on interest payments, which could lead to less generous dividend increases in the future.

Shareholder Returns

Eastman pays a quarterly dividend of currently $0.76, which translates to a yield of 2.5% based on the current share price of $120. The company has increased its dividend since 2011 and notably also in 2020, underscoring management’s shareholder-friendly attitude. The long-term dividend growth rate is very strong at a CAGR of 12%. Over the last seven years, EMN has increased its dividend at a CAGR of 9.3%. The payout ratio is very modest at typically around 30% to 40% of nFCF. In addition to the dividend, the company also repurchases its own shares. The dilutive effect of share-based compensations is obviously more than offset by share repurchases, as is shown by the reduction in diluted shares outstanding from 150 million in 2015 to 135 million in 2021.

It can be concluded that thanks to the robust free cash flow, Eastman’s dividend appears very safe and is expected to continue to grow at a healthy rate, as also the payout ratio is still far from concerning. However, if interest rates rise materially, dividend growth is expected to slow down or stop altogether, as the company’s interest coverage ratio is not particularly robust (see previous section).

Risks

EMN is highly sensitive to the overall economy and as a consequence, the main risk is an upcoming recession and the associated decline in demand for products that contain Eastman’s materials, such as cars, beddings and building materials. As a materials/industrial company, EMN’s margins are not the strongest and are likely to drop significantly in a recession. However, it should be reiterated that the company adds significant value to a large number of otherwise commoditized products and is hence in a better position than, e.g., Dow or BASF.

The company has weathered the recent recessions very well, which is also underscored by the company’s decision to increase its dividend even in an extraordinary year like 2020.

Other risks include the already discussed refinancing at potentially unfavorable rates. Eastman appears to be exposed to this risk due to upcoming maturities of $1.9 billion between 2022 and 2024.

Personally, I see the main risk in buying shares of this cyclical company at or near the top of an industrial cycle. Of course, this risk can easily be avoided by simply refraining from buying cyclical stocks at historically above-average valuations.

Valuation

As taught by Peter Lynch, cyclical companies like Eastman should be avoided during economic expansions and bought during recessions, i.e., when the price-to-earnings ratio of such companies increases due to weak earnings. Today, EMN trades at a moderate premium to its six-year average valuations:

Own work, based on EMN's 2015 to 2020 10-Ks and the most recent earnings release

An equity value-based discounted cash flow analysis for Eastman, based on an average nFCF of $870 million, a terminal growth rate of 2% and a cost of equity of 10% suggests that the company is significantly overvalued (i.e., a fair value estimate of $82). Put differently, at a share price of $120, the market expects Eastman to grow its nFCF by 4.5% ad infinitum, which appears unrealistically optimistic in my opinion. Certainly, a reduction of the cost of equity would also result in a higher fair value estimate but I argue that the cash flows of a cyclical company should be discounted by an annual rate of at least 10%.

Eastman also trades at a modest premium to its historical average dividend yield, as is illustrated on Seeking Alpha’s dividend yield tab. In my opinion, a dividend yield of at least 3.3% to 3.5% should be targeted by a prudent investor with a preference for income-oriented investments. At a current yield of only 2.5%, it takes a considerable amount of time to arrive at a meaningful yield on cost, even considering the strong growth rate of Eastman's dividend.

Conclusion

Eastman is certainly a strong company, as is emphasized by the industry-leading margins, the robust return on invested capital and rapidly growing dividend. Investors seeking exposure to the chemicals sector are likely to be well served with Eastman, which is strongly focused on value-added products and is a market leader in several segments. Nevertheless, the fact that the company’s profitability is at times below its WACC is a point of criticism.

At a share price of $120, the stock appears slightly overvalued from the perspective of historically observed multiples and severely overvalued from the perspective of a discounted cash flow analysis. Income-oriented investors may also be looking elsewhere at the moment, as the current dividend yield is anything but enticing for a cyclical business, even though the dividend growth rate is phenomenal.

Personally, I consider Eastman a potential addition to a well-diversified portfolio but would only consider opening a position at a share price of less than $90, i.e., a dividend yield of at least 3.4%.

Scope of Global Automotive Sensors Market:

Automotive sensors are used to reduce fuel consumption and to reduce the weight of the vehicle on board. Automotive sensors are smart sensors that can be used to control and process vehicle temperature, coolant levels, and oil pressure. Many types of sensors are used in the automotive industry such as speed sensors, coolant sensors, temperature sensors, pressure sensors, magnetic sensors, voltage sensors, and oxygen sensors. Automotive sensors are one of the fastest-growing technologies in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) segment.

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the automotive industry, with many manufacturing facilities shutting down, supply chain disruptions, and international trade disruptions. Consumer demand has declined, leading many automakers to reduce their production capacity for new vehicles, limiting market opportunities for automotive sensor suppliers.

Global Automotive Sensors Market Dynamics:

The market for automotive sensors is rising exponentially in line with the in general growth of the automotive market. The high adoption of ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) and AD (Automated Driving) systems is the main reason for the growing demand for automotive sensors. According to Brandessence Research, consumers have purchased about 10 million autonomous vehicles by 2020. Powertrain sensors play an important role in the efficient operation of engines, transmission systems, and alternators. Chassis sensors supervise functions like steering, braking, and suspension. A cluster of sensors is used in ADAS / AD systems, braking systems, and power steering systems of Autonomous Vehicles (AV) Level 3 vehicles of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). For example, body sensors capture and transmit information about door/roof closures, seating area, and sunlight/rainfall, and can trigger notifications and perform basic functions accordingly. Thus, autonomous vehicles deployed with a variety of sensors can reduce driver stress and increase their productivity. Therefore, the increasing adoption of autonomous vehicles is largely driving the growth of the automotive sensors market.

Story continues

The competitive landscape from the players in the automotive sensors market is growing rapidly, giving a big boost to the automotive sensors market. According to the Brandessence Research; they have a combined market share of over 30% in 2021. The automotive sensor market is highly competitive due to the rise of regional players and start-ups. Rising sales of automobiles in emerging economies such as Brazil, Turkey, Iran, and India are forcing market players to enter the market by introducing new products at lower prices. For instance; in April 2021, Honda released the ADAS ""Honda Sensing Elite"", a state-of-the-art advanced driver-assistance system for a special range of vehicles available in Japan. The system has SAE level 3 capability and comes with a traffic jam pilot module. Also, in August 2020, Positek launched a new line of in-cylinder mounted position sensors ""P 116 series"" with coalescent electronics. These linear position sensors offer Positek's patented linear inductive position sensor, non-contact inductive technology, and new micro-electronic ASIC circuits. These sensors are compact and comfortably installed single device with numerous electrical interface options. These sensors have a long life and are extremely accurate, reliable, and durable. In addition, Curtis-Wright recently launched their new rotary position sensor ""WM-H10"", a Hall-effect sensor that provides two separate and electro-isolated outputs. This shaft-operated sensor comes with two separates, electrically isolated outputs and is designed for highway on/off applications.

The business of automotive sensors is an OEM-overwhelmed business as there is an immature post-retail for automotive sensors. For different other business fragments, like industrial sensors and home automation gadgets, aftermarket assumes a significant part in advancing the market development. However, in the case of car sensors, the vast technical features for sensors are given by the vehicle producer or the level 1 provider, which is the fundamental purpose for the trouble in the commercialization of automotive sensors. Similarly, for various new sensors like radar, lidar, and proximity sensors, the retrofit market is relatively small due to the low penetration of these sensors in automobiles.
