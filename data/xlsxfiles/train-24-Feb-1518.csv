Naomi Schalit, The Conversation

(THE CONVERSATION) This is a frightening moment. Russia has invaded Ukraine, and certainly those most frightened right now are the people of Ukraine. But violent aggression – a war mounted by a country with vast military resources against a smaller, weaker country – strikes fear in all of us. As a Washington Post headline writer recently wrote: The Ukraine crisis is “5,000 miles away but hitting home.”

The Conversation U.S. has spent the past couple of months digging into the history and politics of Ukraine and Russia. We’ve looked at their cultures, their religions, their military and technological capacities. We’ve provided you with stories about NATO, about cyberwarfare, the Cold War and the efficacy of sanctions.

Below, you’ll find a selection of stories from our coverage. We hope they will help you understand that today may feel both inevitable – yet inexplicable.

1. The US promised to protect Ukraine

In 1994, Ukraine got a signed commitment from Russia, the U.S. and the U.K. in which the three countries promised to protect the newly independent state’s sovereignty.

“Ukraine as an independent state was born from the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union,” write scholars Lee Feinstein of Indiana University and Mariana Budjeryn of Harvard. “Its independence came with a complicated Cold War inheritance: the world’s third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons. Ukraine was one of the three non-Russian former Soviet states, including Belarus and Kazakhstan, that emerged from the Soviet collapse with nuclear weapons on its territory.”

The 1994 agreement was signed in return for Ukraine giving up the nuclear weapons within its borders, sending them to Russia for dismantling. But the agreement, not legally binding, was broken by Russia’s illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014. And today’s invasion is yet another example of the weakness of that agreement.

2. Clues to how Russia will wage war

During the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Russia invaded Georgia, a country on the Black Sea. In 2014, Putin ordered troops to seize Crimea, a peninsula that juts into the Black Sea and housed a Russian naval base.

West Point scholar and career U.S. special forces officer Liam Collins conducted field research on the 2008 and 2014 wars in Georgia and Ukraine.

“From what I have learned, I expect a possible Russian invasion would start with cyberattacks and electronic warfare to sever communications between Ukraine’s capital and the troops. Shortly thereafter, tanks and mechanized infantry formations supported by the Russian air force would cross at multiple points along the nearly 1,200-mile border, assisted by Russian special forces. Russia would seek to bypass large urban areas.”

3. Spies replaced by smartphones

If you love spy movies, you’ve got an image of how intelligence is gathered: agents on the ground and satellites in the sky.

But you’re way out of date. These days, writes Craig Nazareth, a scholar of intelligence and information operations at the University of Arizona, “massive amounts of valuable information are publicly available, and not all of it is collected by governments. Satellites and drones are much cheaper than they were even a decade ago, allowing private companies to operate them, and nearly everyone has a smartphone with advanced photo and video capabilities.”

This means people around the world may see this invasion unfold in real time. “Commercial imaging companies are posting up-to-the-minute, geographically precise images of Russia’s military forces. Several news agencies are regularly monitoring and reporting on the situation. TikTok users are posting video of Russian military equipment on rail cars allegedly on their way to augment forces already in position around Ukraine. And internet sleuths are tracking this flow of information.”

4. Targeting the US with cyberattacks

As Russia edged closer to war with Ukraine, cybersecurity scholar Justin Pelletier at Rochester Institute of Technology wrote of the growing likelihood of destructive Russian cyberattacks against the U.S.

Pelletier quoted a Department of Homeland Security bulletin from late January that said, “We assess that Russia would consider initiating a cyberattack against the Homeland if it perceived a U.S. or NATO response to a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine threatened its long-term national security.”

And that’s not all. “Americans can probably expect to see Russian-sponsored cyber-activities working in tandem with propaganda campaigns,” writes Pelletier. The aim of such campaigns: to use “social and other online media like a military-grade fog machine that confuses the U.S. population and encourages mistrust in the strength and validity of the U.S. government.”

5. Will war sink Putin’s stock with Russians?

“War ultimately requires an enormous amount of public goodwill and support for a political leader,” writes Arik Burakovsky, a scholar of Russia and public opinion at Tufts University’s Fletcher School.

[Over 140,000 readers rely on The Conversation’s newsletters to understand the world. Sign up today.]

Putin’s support among Russians has been rising as the country massed troops along the Ukrainian border - the public believes that its leaders are defending Russia by standing up to the West. But Burakovsky writes that “the rally ‘round the flag effect of supporting political leadership during an international crisis will likely be short-lived.”

Most Russians, it turns out, don’t want war. The return of body bags from the front could well prove damaging to Putin domestically.

""Just going down to check on the...er... chicken coop, Megs"", he might have said, before swiping the car keys from the hall table and legging it to watch the LA Rams beat the Cincinnati Bengals in the Super Bowl.

For there he was with his cousin Eugenie watching the game. No wife, no kids. Freeee-dom! And freedom from controversy too, because there's nothing eyebrowraising about being with a cousin. She's family and we know she and Harry have been good mates since they were little. Cousins are marvellous accessories, because there's a sense of shared adversity (all those eye-rolling details of your wider family to groan about) and you're usually relaxed in each other's company because there's nothing to prove and nothing to hide. Familiarity breeds content. A relationship with a cousin is very much take-it-orleave-it. If you don't see each other for years it doesn't particularly matter. And as well as first cousins there are second cousins and cousins once or twice removed. Nobody ever seems quite sure what that means, but you might send them a Christmas card anyway. If you don't really like them they can be forgetten in a way that isn't allowed with closer relatives. In fiction the long-lost cousin has traditionally provided a neat way to bring together characters who wouldn't normally meet. Urban sophisticates discover ""country cousins"" living in the sticks. Orphaned heroines are sent to live with distant relatives who have awful offspring to deal with.

Prince Harry and Princess Eugenie have always had a close friendship.

Prince Harry and wife Meghan Markle

Harry Potter had to live with his aunt and uncle Petunia and Vernon Dursley, only to be bullied by nasty coz Dudley. Conversely, when Enid Blyton wrote the Famous Five stories, she understood how much pleasure children can get from being with cousins. Siblings Anne, Julian and Dick are forever being palmed off for the school holidays on their blissfully inattentive Aunt Fanny and Uncle Quentin, and spend time in Cornwall with their tomboy cousin George and her dog Timmy. This gives them endless scope for adventures with lashings of ginger beer. There's nothing like that heady mix of familiarity and novelty that a visit to cousins can provide. In Andrew, Eugenie has the most embarrassing dad in the world. Harry has possibly the most annoying wife. They have a lot to discuss. But maybe they parked all that and kept it simple.That's the joy of cousins. -------- Cricket's cancelled

Oxford University v Cambridge University in 2014.

The MCC has cancelled the 200-year-old traditional cricket fixture between Eton and Harrow at Lord's, along with the one between Oxford and Cambridge. In the name of diversity, natch. Cricket commentator Henry Blofeld, who has played in both matches, said: ""I suppose the 'antis' will be cheering and old farts like me will be sad."" Not that this match was always a civilised occasion. In Anne De Courcy's wonderful book 1939: The Last Season, an account of the summer before the outbreak of war, she describes the violent aftermath as Harrow finally beat Eton for the first time in 31 years. She quotes the Sunday Express's report: ""When the winning run was scored, Lord's became a bear garden and it wasn't the boys that started it, but their elders, pillars of county society, figures on the stock exchange, grey-haired businessmen. ""Elderly men took off their toppers, which were kicked from their hands. One distinguished-looking Old Etonian punched a clerical Old Harrovian. ""Two other Old Harrovians set upon their school enemy. ""He was thrown to the ground, his tie torn off and his coat lifted exposing light blue braces... in a few seconds he was debagged."" -------- Wags at war

Rebekah Vardy and Coleen Rooney are feuding over leaked stories.

The ongoing Coleen Rooney/ RebekahVardy feud is like one of those films where a couple of creaky old dinosaurs are brought back to life by a mad scientist and begin a fight to the finish, roaring and grappling, gouging with acrylic nails and whipping each other with hair extensions. (To recap this whole lumbering saga: Back in 2019 Coleen was dubbed ""Wagatha Christie"" when she put false information on social media in an attempt to unmask who was responsible for leaking stories about her. This led her to conclude that Jamie Vardy's wife Rebekah was responsible.)

Last week, after a pause in hostilities, Coleen lost the latest round in her libel battle when she failed to get permission to sue Mrs V's publicity agent. Rooney and Vardy are creatures from another era when handbags-at-dawn millionaire wags added to the gaiety of the nation along with the wayward behaviour of some of their spouses. How different from today's footballers (apart from the one who played keepy-uppy with his cat) who tend to be saintly, clean-living youngsters with partners to match. -------- Loadsamoney

London-born actor Jude Law

Jude Law stars in a film called The Nest currently on Netflix. It's set in the 1980s where he plays a City trader who's spinning too many plates and maintaining a lifestyle far above his means (private schools for the kids, a horse for his wife). Slumped in a taxi (which he can't pay for) the cabbie asks him what he does. ""I pretend to be rich,"" says the Jude Law character. A great line. We all pretended to be richer than we were in the loadsamoney 1980s. And, according to a survey by King's College, two-thirds of us are nostalgic for that flashy decade of shoulder pads and Duran Duran. Well it was more fun than now, that's for sure. -------- Quite the scandal

Scandal in a peaceful Oxfordshire village when Air Marshal Andrew Turner was spotted by neighbour Simon Herbert at a distance of 30 metres, naked in his paddock and ""not even wearing shoes"". Turner insists he had merely popped out (as it were) to retrieve a tennis ball for his dogs on a hot August day and has sent an apology which doesn't seem to have been quite enough for the Herberts. Mr Herbert's partner is still said to be ""upset"" by the sight of the air marshal's full regalia. If all this wasn't hilarious enough the village in question is called Cane End. Ooh missus!

An effort now underway to establish a car-free zone bigger than Manhattan in central Berlin, a relatively dense location where 15% of the surface area is used for road traffic, just might succeed.

But what about a place like Los Angeles County, a sprawling megalopolis where a nearly equal percentage of surface area is used just for parking – on top of the hundreds of square kilometers occupied by essential roads and clogged freeways?

A legacy of planning hinged on cars has left many urban areas both disjointed and disadvantaged in terms of designing for a more sustainable future. But it’s possible to undo some of that damage.

In Los Angeles, the mayor wants to slash the driving done in the city by half over the next few decades, and has expressed interest in charging entry fees for some vehicles – similar to a scheme in London. Many local residents may be surprised to learn there’s a subway system expanding beneath their feet, and bicycle ridership has boomed during the pandemic (though its staying power is uncertain).

Los Angeles is not the only city trying to shake its car dependency. Bogotá, which didn’t have a public transportation system as recently as 1999, has regulated the number of privately owned cars that can be on the roads at any given time, and instituted an annual car-free day. Mexico City has capped the parking spaces allowed for cars in new developments, and added requirements for bicycle spaces.

There are compelling reasons to erase cars from the urban equation, like cutting emissions and improving the quality of life.

In fact, the perception of cars as an urban design flaw may hold whether they spew carbon or use electric power. An advocate for the proposed car-free zone in Berlin said the aim should not just be transitioning to electric cars within cities, but “the removal of vehicles in general.”

However, cities like Los Angeles can be hindered by vast amounts of parking space, which inhibits the density conducive to public-transportation use and only makes driving more convenient.

Other locales have been able to move more aggressively. Paris has invested heavily in infrastructure for bicycling and walking, and detailed plans this week to sharply limit car traffic in the heart of the city starting in 2024. Central Oslo is now basically car-free.

Finding the right fit for cars in cities

The idea of actively discouraging car travel in cities isn’t new. In 1975, Singapore established a program to charge drivers who wanted to enter the center of the city-state.

Since then, general awareness of vehicle emissions and their role in the climate crisis has grown significantly. Cities account for an estimated 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and roughly a third of their emissions are attributable to transport.

It doesn’t help that cities also regularly register significant numbers of traffic fatalities, or that millions of children develop asthma every year due to air pollution from cars and trucks.

Eliminating the use of cars for short trips within cities may be economical, particularly when the cost of filling a gas tank can spike in response to geopolitical tension. Replacing those car trips with walking and bicycling also brings serious health benefits.

Image: World Economic Forum

Advocates of the proposal to blanket central Berlin with a car-free zone say it will spur investment in public transportation. Under the plan, people who need the use of a car for health reasons could apply for driving permits, and everyone else would be able to register 12 private trips per year with a car-sharing service – for things like getting to the airport.

Initiatives like this are not always welcome. A rule in Madrid that banned certain vehicles from the city center became a political issue before it was scrapped last year.

And there are cases where cars may be seen as crucial lifelines that shouldn’t be imperiled – particularly for people with disabilities and the elderly.



Some endeavors aim to reduce urban congestion while still allowing people to stay in their cars. A company founded by Elon Musk unveiled plans several years ago to bore a tunnel beneath several kilometers of Los Angeles, through which electric cars could safely speed from one part of town to another and avoid backed-up freeways.

Any mention of the project was reportedly scrubbed from the company’s website last year.

The site still lists several other initiatives, though video taken earlier this year at one of its tunnels in Las Vegas appeared to show it suffering from something it purports to eliminate: congestion.

For more context, here are links to further reading from the World Economic Forum's Strategic Intelligence platform:

Even in a place often called Britain’s “motor city” a desire to improve air quality and increase cycling spurred ambitious plans for car-free zones, according to this piece. (CityMetric)

Worth investing in that cover – this study found that babies and children in bicycle trailers breathe in a lot more polluted air than the adults pulling them, though a trailer cover can halve the exposure to fine particles. (Science Daily)

Decades before cars went into mass production, a unit of “Buffalo Soldiers” bicycled more than 3,000 kilometers across the US to demonstrate the technology’s potential. (JSTOR Daily)

There are about 1,000 e-buses on India’s roads, according to this analysis, and 11,000 must be deployed each year for the next nine years to help the country hit its target of net-zero emissions by 2070. (World Resources Institute)

Phoenix, Arizona might be the last place where one would expect to see an effort to ban cars, but according to this report a local residential community aims to prohibit resident parking and will instead subsidize access to ridesharing and public transportation. (Next City)

To be liveable and greener, cities must consistently incentivize the use of public transportation and discourage car use, according to this analysis – which uses the Dubai Road and Transport Authority as an example. (LSE)

Do bikeshare systems complement or replace traditional public transit? This paper’s findings suggest they function pretty well together. (Science Daily)

AUSTIN, Feb. 17, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AYRO, Inc. (Nasdaq: AYRO) (“AYRO” or the “Company”), a designer and manufacturer of electric, purpose-built delivery vehicles and solutions for micro distribution, micro mobility, and last-mile delivery, provides an update on recent corporate and strategic initiatives from CEO Thomas Wittenschlaeger:



Dear Shareholders and Investors,

In the business update I provided in mid-December at our Annual Shareholders Meeting, I highlighted a number of initiatives we are currently undertaking at AYRO. Now, in mid-February, with further accomplishments and additional initiatives underway, I wanted to provide investors with an update on some of these initiatives.

We continue to take steps to shift our supply chain structure away from Asia and to a North America-based strategy. Having more localized control of our supply chain will be critical to shortening our vehicle delivery time and lowering our unit costs. We will have more to discuss around this topic in future updates. For now, please note that this initiative continues to be at the cornerstone of our manufacturing strategy.

Customer interest in the low-speed vehicle (LSV) food delivery segment continues to be robust. In many urban areas, a LSV solution to food delivery is quite feasible and appropriate, and we believe our leadership position in the LSV segment should bode well for our competitive positioning. Moreover, our distribution partnerships with Club Car and Gallery Carts remain quite important in this segment and allow us to offer food box architecture and configuration solutions, which are necessary components of food delivery. We look forward to additional progress on this front and further honing our LSV strategy.

With respect to our cost structure and overhead expenses, we recently reduced our senior staff footprint and associated expenses by 40%, except for related one-time separation costs, with no discernible impact on ongoing operations. As I mentioned in our December update, every aspect of our operation must be justified, including personnel and outsourced services. Although our cash position is quite healthy at $77M as of September 30, 2021 and we have no debt, remaining vigilant on expense control must continue to be an essential part of our operations.

Story continues

Given our strong financial condition, we are also evaluating other options for the strategic deployment of capital beyond our ongoing strategic initiatives. We believe there are potentially other segments of the electric vehicle (EV) market that could be additive to our planned suite of offerings and services. While we are not committed to this approach, we believe it prudent to assess the EV landscape for potential businesses that would allow us to accelerate our revenue growth and reach critical scale faster.

Lastly, I wish to underscore that we will recognize record revenue and record unit deliveries of the Club Car Current in the fourth quarter of 2021, even amid the unprecedented supply chain disruptions affecting all businesses. Additionally, we expect sequential revenue growth in each of the first two quarters of 2022.

Supporting this revenue outlook is Club Car’s recent introduction of the lithium-battery powered version of the Current. We are optimistic that buyers will find this version quite appealing, for not only does this lithium version bring inherent “green” advantages over the standard lead-acid battery version, but it also offers enhanced hill climbing performance and air conditioning for warmer climates.

In summary, we continue to make progress in positioning AYRO for sustainable success in the EV market, and specifically in the LSV segment of the EV market. The food delivery market represents an enormous market opportunity that goes beyond simply the vehicle component. We intend to capitalize on this distinction and will certainly share additional progress on this front in the future. We take expense control seriously and are adamant about being incredibly efficient with our capital. Furthermore, we will look to be opportunistic with our capital as well, and we are exploring potential partnerships and acquisitions that could be synergistic with our competitive stance in the market. Lastly, we do not want to give the impression that we have taken our eye off our need and ability to grow our revenue. We will report record revenue in the fourth quarter and, based on our current forecast, expect record revenue again in both the first and second quarters of 2022.

I would like to thank all of our loyal shareholders and look forward to providing additional updates in the future.

Regards,

Thomas M. Wittenschlaeger

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements include, without limitation: the ability of AYRO’s suppliers to deliver parts and assemble vehicles; the ability of the purchaser to terminate or reduce purchase orders; AYRO has a history of losses and has never been profitable, and AYRO expects to incur additional losses in the future and may never be profitable; the impact of public health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic; the market for AYRO’s products is developing and may not develop as expected and AYRO, accordingly, may never meet its targeted production and sales goals; AYRO’s limited operating history makes evaluating its business and future prospects difficult and may increase the risk of any investment in its securities; AYRO may experience lower-than-anticipated market acceptance of its vehicles; developments in alternative technologies or improvements in the internal combustion engine may have a materially adverse effect on the demand for AYRO’s electric vehicles; the markets in which AYRO operates are highly competitive, and AYRO may not be successful in competing in these industries; AYRO relies on and intends to continue to rely on a single third-party supplier in China for the sub-assemblies in semi-knocked-down state for all of its vehicles; AYRO may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm AYRO’s financial condition and liquidity if AYRO is not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims; increases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials, in particular lithium-ion cells, could harm AYRO’s business; AYRO may be required to raise additional capital to fund its operations, and such capital raising may be costly or difficult to obtain and could dilute AYRO stockholders’ ownership interests, and AYRO’s long term capital requirements are subject to numerous risks; AYRO may fail to comply with environmental and safety laws and regulations; and AYRO is subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair AYRO’s ability to compete in international market due to licensing requirements and subject AYRO to liability if AYRO is not in compliance with applicable laws. A discussion of these and other factors with respect to AYRO is set forth in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Form 10-Q. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and AYRO disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Russia has invaded Ukraine, and certainly those most frightened right now are the people of Ukraine. But violent aggression – a war mounted by a country with vast military resources against a smaller, weaker country – strikes fear in all of us. As a Washington Post headline writer recently wrote: The Ukraine crisis is “5,000 miles away but hitting home.”

The Conversation U.S. has spent the past couple of months digging into the history and politics of Ukraine and Russia. We’ve looked at their cultures, their religions, their military and technological capacities. We’ve provided you with stories about NATO, about cyberwarfare, the Cold War and the efficacy of sanctions.

Below, you’ll find a selection of stories from our coverage. We hope they will help you understand that today may feel both inevitable – yet inexplicable.

1. The US promised to protect Ukraine

In 1994, Ukraine got a signed commitment from Russia, the U.S. and the U.K. in which the three countries promised to protect the newly independent state’s sovereignty.

“Ukraine as an independent state was born from the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union,” write scholars Lee Feinstein of Indiana University and Mariana Budjeryn of Harvard. “Its independence came with a complicated Cold War inheritance: the world’s third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons. Ukraine was one of the three non-Russian former Soviet states, including Belarus and Kazakhstan, that emerged from the Soviet collapse with nuclear weapons on its territory.”

The 1994 agreement was signed in return for Ukraine giving up the nuclear weapons within its borders, sending them to Russia for dismantling. But the agreement, not legally binding, was broken by Russia’s illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014. And today’s invasion is yet another example of the weakness of that agreement.

Read more: Ukraine got a signed commitment in 1994 to ensure its security – but can the US and allies stop Putin's aggression now?

2. Clues to how Russia will wage war

During the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Russia invaded Georgia, a country on the Black Sea. In 2014, Putin ordered troops to seize Crimea, a peninsula that juts into the Black Sea and housed a Russian naval base.

West Point scholar and career U.S. special forces officer Liam Collins conducted field research on the 2008 and 2014 wars in Georgia and Ukraine.

“From what I have learned, I expect a possible Russian invasion would start with cyberattacks and electronic warfare to sever communications between Ukraine’s capital and the troops. Shortly thereafter, tanks and mechanized infantry formations supported by the Russian air force would cross at multiple points along the nearly 1,200-mile border, assisted by Russian special forces. Russia would seek to bypass large urban areas.”

3. Spies replaced by smartphones

If you love spy movies, you’ve got an image of how intelligence is gathered: agents on the ground and satellites in the sky.

But you’re way out of date. These days, writes Craig Nazareth, a scholar of intelligence and information operations at the University of Arizona, “massive amounts of valuable information are publicly available, and not all of it is collected by governments. Satellites and drones are much cheaper than they were even a decade ago, allowing private companies to operate them, and nearly everyone has a smartphone with advanced photo and video capabilities.”

This means people around the world may see this invasion unfold in real time. “Commercial imaging companies are posting up-to-the-minute, geographically precise images of Russia’s military forces. Several news agencies are regularly monitoring and reporting on the situation. TikTok users are posting video of Russian military equipment on rail cars allegedly on their way to augment forces already in position around Ukraine. And internet sleuths are tracking this flow of information.”

Read more: Technology is revolutionizing how intelligence is gathered and analyzed – and opening a window onto Russian military activity around Ukraine

4. Targeting the US with cyberattacks

As Russia edged closer to war with Ukraine, cybersecurity scholar Justin Pelletier at Rochester Institute of Technology wrote of the growing likelihood of destructive Russian cyberattacks against the U.S.

Pelletier quoted a Department of Homeland Security bulletin from late January that said, “We assess that Russia would consider initiating a cyberattack against the Homeland if it perceived a U.S. or NATO response to a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine threatened its long-term national security.”

And that’s not all. “Americans can probably expect to see Russian-sponsored cyber-activities working in tandem with propaganda campaigns,” writes Pelletier. The aim of such campaigns: to use “social and other online media like a military-grade fog machine that confuses the U.S. population and encourages mistrust in the strength and validity of the U.S. government.”

Read more: Russia could unleash disruptive cyberattacks against the US – but efforts to sow confusion and division are more likely

5. Will war sink Putin’s stock with Russians?

“War ultimately requires an enormous amount of public goodwill and support for a political leader,” writes Arik Burakovsky, a scholar of Russia and public opinion at Tufts University’s Fletcher School.

[Over 140,000 readers rely on The Conversation’s newsletters to understand the world. Sign up today.]

Putin’s support among Russians has been rising as the country massed troops along the Ukrainian border - the public believes that its leaders are defending Russia by standing up to the West. But Burakovsky writes that “the rally ‘round the flag effect of supporting political leadership during an international crisis will likely be short-lived.”

Most Russians, it turns out, don’t want war. The return of body bags from the front could well prove damaging to Putin domestically.

Putin of Russia announced on television that he had decided “to carry out a special military operation” in Ukraine, explosions were reported across the country.

Blasts were heard in Kyiv, the capital; in Kharkiv, the second largest city; and in Kramatorsk in the region of Donetsk, one of two eastern Ukrainian territories claimed by Russia-backed separatists since 2014.

Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian troops had landed in the southern port city of Odessa and were crossing from Russia into Kharkiv. Footage captured by security cameras showed Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine from Crimea, the peninsula that Russia seized in 2014.

Rocket attacks targeted Ukrainian fighter jets parked at an airport outside Kyiv, and Ukraine closed its airspace to commercial flights, citing the “potential hazard to civilian aviation.”

More than 40 Ukrainian soldiers were killed and dozens were wounded in the fighting on Thursday morning, said Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.

As air raid sirens blared in Kyiv, the western city of Lviv and other urban areas, residents rushed to take shelter in bus and subway stations. In Kyiv, people packed up their cars and waited in long lines to fill up with gas on their way out of the city. In eastern Ukraine, early signs of panic appeared on the streets as lines formed at A.T.M.s and gas stations.

With attacks across the country, it quickly became clear that Russia’s campaign, whatever Mr. Putin meant by a “special military operation,” was aimed at far more than the rebel territories in the east. Within an hour, Ukraine’s state emergency service said that attacks had been launched in 10 regions of Ukraine, primarily in the east and south, and that reports of new shelling were “coming in constantly.”

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, called it “a full-scale invasion of Ukraine” and said his country would defend itself, while calling on the world to “stop Putin.”

Russia’s Defense Ministry said that it was using “high-precision weapons” to disable military infrastructure, air defense facilities, military airfields and Ukrainian army planes, Russia’s state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. But the ministry said it was not attacking cities, and promised that “the civilian population is not at risk.”

The Ukrainian authorities said that invading naval forces were coming ashore at multiple points, including in Kharkiv and the southern city of Kherson. Three emergency workers were injured when a command post was struck by shelling in Nizhyn, in the north, and six people were trapped under rubble when the city’s airport came under attack, Ukraine’s Interior Ministry reported.

Military depots, warehouses and National Guard were hit with artillery blasts, the ministry said.

As dawn broke in Kyiv, Mr. Zelensky of Ukraine said he had declared martial law. The country’s defense minister told citizens that the army was “fending off enemy forces” and “doing everything it can to protect you.”

But the army was under siege. In the east, Russia-backed separatists — their ranks bolstered by the arrival of hundreds of Russian mercenaries in recent days, according to European officials — said they were hammering Ukrainian troops along the entire 250-mile front line that has divided the rebels and Ukrainian forces since 2014.

Seeking to capture the entire territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, which Mr. Putin recognized as independent on Monday, the rebels were “using all weapons at their disposal,” the Russian news media reported. Ukrainian officials said the attacks included artillery strikes.

Ukraine’s state border service reported that Russian troops stationed in Belarus, north of Ukraine, had launched an attack with support from the Belarusian military. Russia had deployed as many as 30,000 troops to Belarus for exercises this month that the United States warned could provide cover for an attack against Kyiv, which lies a fast 140-mile drive away from a main border crossing. President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus denied that his forces were involved.

By midmorning in Kyiv, Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had disabled all of Ukraine’s air defenses and air bases. Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian forces had captured two villages in the Luhansk region.

The fighting intensified as Ukrainian forces shot down six Russian fighters and a helicopter in a fight to maintain control over key cities, a senior Ukrainian military official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to release information outside official channels. Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, called on all Ukrainian civilians to join the fight and enlist with territorial defense units.

“Ukraine is moving into all-out defense mode,” he said."

This is the latest in my series of articles where I provide predictions of annual dividend increases for a variety of long-term dividend growth companies. Back at the end of January, I provided predictions for 19 dividend growth companies that have historically announced annual payout increases in the first half of February. In this article I'll look at another 14 dividend growth companies that I expect will announce their annual dividend increases in the second half of February.

In addition to the companies for which I gave predictions, several other companies announced annual increases:

- Chip company Analog Devices (ADI) capped off 20 years of dividend growth with a 10.1% increase to $3.04. The company has a forward yield of 1.88%

- Utility Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG) announced a 5.9% increase to $2.16, giving the company a forward yield of 3.35%. This is Public Service's 11th year of dividend growth.

- Waste Management (WM) announced its 19th year of dividend growth with a 13.0% increase to $2.60, resulting in a forward yield of 1.82%.

- Finally, specialty machinery company ITT (ITT) finished its first decade of dividend growth with a 20.0% increase to $1.06, giving the company a forward yield of 1.20%

Here are the results from my last article (the original predictions are available here), followed by my predictions for the dividend increases that I'm expecting to be announced in the second half of February:

Actual: 7.0% increase to $4.60

Forward yield: 2.77%

The latest dividend increase from the beverage and snack company is close to its long-term growth rate of 8%.

Prudential Financial (PRU) - 14 years

Prediction: 10.4 - 13.0% increase to $5.08 - $5.20

Actual: 4.3% increase to $4.80

Forward yield: 4.07%

Despite good EPS growth, the insurance company's latest increase was well below historical rates.

The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW) - 44 years

Prediction: 7.3 - 10.0% increase to $2.36 - $2.42

Actual: Deferred to second half of February

The paint company should announce a dividend increase next week.

T. Rowe Price (TROW) - 36 years

Prediction: 19.4 - 21.3% increase to $5.16 - $5.24

Actual: 11.1% increase to $4.80

Forward yield: 3.27%

While still a good boost, the investment company decided to slow its dividend growth from last year's 20% increase.

United Parcel Services (UPS) - 13 years

Prediction: 6.9 - 8.3% increase to $4.36 - $4.42

Actual: 49.0% increase to $6.08

Forward yield: 2.80%

It was an absolute blowout increase from the shipping and logistics company.

Xylem (XYL) - 10 years

Prediction: 8.9 - 12.5% increase to $1.22 - $1.26

Actual: 7.1% increase to $1.20

Forward yield: 1.32%

The technology company ends its first decade of dividend growth with a modest increase.

Predictions for Dividend Increases for the Second Half of February

Here are my predictions for the 14 dividend increases I expect in the second half of February:

Albemarle Corporation (ALB) - 27 years

Chemical company Albemarle specializes in lithium, bromine and catalysts. The company's products are used in a variety of industries including petroleum, electric vehicles, pharmaceuticals, and food safety. After quickly growing earnings and its payout, Albemarle's growth slowed down. Last year, Albemarle's EPS fell 32% and the company is looking at another 3% drop in 2021. With these EPS numbers, Albemarle will likely increase its dividend by a minimal amount, just like last year.

Prediction: 1.3 - 2.6% increase to $1.58 - $1.60

Predicted Forward Yield: 0.65 - 0.66%

Best Buy (BBY) - 18 years

The electronics retailer has benefitted from the transition to work-from-home during the pandemic and, as the pandemic recedes, is also benefitting from the economic recovery. Best Buy has rewarded investors with large payout increases, compounding the dividend by 13% over the last decade, punctuated by a 27% boost last year. After EPS growth of 19% last year, 2021 EPS are 64% ahead of last year's period, which means that investors can look forward to another good year of dividend growth.

Prediction: 17.1 - 21.4% increase to $3.28 - $3.40

Predicted Forward Yield: 3.21 - 3.33%

Chubb Limited (CB) - 28 years

The specialty insurance company knocked it out of the park in 2021. Driven by double-digit premium increases and improved operations, Chubb saw core operating income per share grow by 71%. But while this would normally lead me to predict a double-digit increase in the company's dividend, Chubb has a history of modest payout increases. Over 6 of the last 7 years, the company boosted its annual payout by 8 cents and even in that 7th year, the increase was only 12 cents a share. The company has a consistent dividend growth record and I expect Chubb to be conservative with its finances and limit the dividend increase, although I do expect the annual increase to be more than 8 cents.

Prediction: 3.8 - 5.0% increase to $3.32 - $3.36

Predicted Forward Yield: 1.63 - 1.65%

Essex Property Trust (ESS) - 27 years

Essex Property invests in and develops apartment complexes in major West Coast urban markets like Los Angeles and San Francisco. The company has a total of 62,000 apartments across 250 communities. While Essex has a record of decent dividend increases, with a 10-year growth average of more than 7%, the company's boost last year was a tiny 0.6%. It looks like investors will see another year of slow growth. If not for a legal settlement and unrealized gains in some technology investments, the company would show a drop in core funds from operations (FFO - a measure of profitability that takes tax laws for REITs into account) of nearly 3%. Despite FFO growth when adjusting for these items, it'll be another year of sub-par dividend growth.

Prediction: 0.6 - 1.7% increase to $8.41 - $8.50

Predicted Forward Yield: 2.64 - 2.67%

The Home Depot (HD) - 12 years

The Home Depot continues to hit it out of the park, with double-digit revenue growth in 2020 and through the first 9 months of 2021. With growth in revenues outpacing slower growth in operating expenses, EPS continues to grow very quickly. EPS in 2020 were up 16%, followed by a more than 30% growth in EPS in the first 3 quarters of 2021. This will power more dividend increases that investors have gotten accustomed to - Home Depot has a 10-year growth average of more than 20%. Last year's 10% increase was small by historical comparison, but it looks like the company will reward investors with a larger increase this year.

Prediction: 13.6 - 15.2% increase to $7.50 - $7.60

Predicted Forward Yield: 2.12 - 2.15%

The Coca-Cola Company (KO) - 59 years

After a pullback in earnings in 2019 led to a token increase in the Coca-Cola's dividend, sales and earnings growth are driving expectations to faster dividend growth for the beverage company. Sales growth is up in all geographic regions and in all business sectors, with the biggest income growth in North and Latin America. Overall, adjusted EPS is up 19% in 2021 and the company is expecting another 5 - 6% growth in 2022. With the return of EPS growth, investors can look forward to a dividend boost closer to Coca-Cola's 10-year growth average of 6%.

Prediction: 4.8 - 7.1% increase to $1.76 - $1.80

Predicted Forward Yield: 2.89 - 2.96%

McGrath RentCorp (MGRC) - 29 years

Although revenues were up 4% in the first 9 months of 2021, operating expenses outpaced the revenue growth, leading to a 14% drop in EPS for the business-to-business rental company that specializes in modular buildings, electronic test equipment, and tanks for storing fluids. 2021's drop follows a small 6% EPS growth in 2020. Although 6% growth should support a mid-single digit increase, with this year's expected drop in earnings, I expect a dividend boost like last year's 4% increase.

Prediction: 2.3 - 4.6% increase to $1.78 - $1.82

Predicted Forward Yield: 2.34 - 2.39%

Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG) - 10 years

The Newark-based electric and gas utility company serves residents and businesses in northern New Jersey and on Long Island. The company is focusing on adjusted EPS, which removes the effect of the loss that the company took on the sale of its fossil fuel assets. PSEG grew adjusted EPS by 4.6% in 2020 and is expecting another 5% adjusted EPS growth in 2021. These levels of growth are consistent with the company's 4% growth rate since beginning its record of dividend boosts. In fact, PSEG has grown its annual dividend by 8 cents over each of the last 7 years, and I think that investors can expect an 8th year of this payout growth.

Prediction: 3.9% increase to $2.12

Predicted Forward Yield: 3.29%

Silgan Holdings (SLGN) - 17 years

Silgan is a manufacturer of metal containers and specialty closures for a variety of applications, including the food and beverage, home and garden, health care, agricultural, and automotive industries. The company has a good record of dividend growth, with a 10-year growth average of more than 9%. Last year, however, Silgan surpassed its average growth rate with a payout boost of nearly 17%. It looks like investors can look forward to another good year. Year-over-year EPS growth in 2021 was 17%, powered by record sales and cash flow. The company expects another 15% EPS growth in 2022. With record earnings expected to continue, I expect Silgan to announce another year of dividend growth in the mid-to-upper teens.

Prediction: 14.3 - 17.8% increase to $0.64 - $0.66

Predicted Forward Yield: 1.50 - 1.55%

SpartanNash Company (SPTN) - 11 years

After record sales and profits in 2020, inflation is starting to bite at this food distributor. SpartanNash supplies supermarkets, including military commissaries worldwide. It should be a good year for investors - the company's adjusted EPS more than doubled last year, and although the EPS is expected to fall this year, the two-year growth rate will still support a good increase this year, especially after the company's small 4% increase last year.

Prediction: 7.5 - 12.5% increase to $0.86 - $0.90

Predicted Forward Yield: 3.12 - 3.27%

Sempra Energy (SRE) - 17 years

Based in San Diego, Sempra provides electric and natural gas service to more than 36 million customers through its subsidiaries San Diego Gas & Electric, Southern California Gas and Oncor Electric Delivery Company. The company has provided adjusted EPS guidance for 2021 and 2022. The company is expecting adjusted EPS growth of between 1 and 3% for this year and next. Although dividend growth has slowed recently, last year the company boosted its payout by 5% driven by 18% EPS growth, more than double the average dividend growth rate over the last 5 years. In anticipation of slowing growth, expect Sempra's dividend growth to retreat to historical levels.

Prediction: 1.4 - 2.3% increase to $4.46 - $4.50

Predicted Forward Yield: 3.31 - 3.34%

Southwest Gas Holdings (SWX) - 15 years

Las Vegas-based Southwest Gas provides natural gas services and infrastructure services to 2 million customers in Nevada and California. The company's 6.7% average growth rate over the last 5 years is relatively high for a utility, but dividend growth has started to slow. Last year the company saw EPS growth of 5%, which drove 4.4% dividend growth. This year, EPS growth is expected to slow to 4%, meaning investors can expect a smaller boost this year.

Prediction: 3.4 - 4.2% increase to $2.46 - $2.48

Predicted Forward Yield: 3.77 - 3.80%

Telephone and Data Systems (TDS) - 47 years

Telephone and Data Systems provides cellular and internet service through its two subsidiaries, US Cellular and TDS Telecom. While the company has improved its cash flow position by redeeming higher yielding debt and replacing it with lower yielding debt, the company's EPS tends to be very steady. Even 2020's EPS surge of 87% is being followed by a drop in EPS of 51%, resulting in minimal EPS growth from 2019 to 2021. Given a lack of EPS growth and a payout yield around 70%, expect another dividend boost similar to last year's 3% increase.

Prediction: 1.4 - 4.3% increase to $0.71 - $0.73

Predicted Forward Yield: 3.40 - 3.49%

Walmart (WMT) - 48 years

Predicting the annual dividend increase for the mega-retailer has gotten easier over the last several years as growth has slowed, driving the company to announce annual boosts of 4 cents a share in each of the last 8 years. The company has also dedicated some of its free cash flow to buy back shares and reduced its outstanding shares by 10% over the last 5 years. Will this be the year that things change? Possibly, as the company grew adjusted EPS by 11% in fiscal 2021 and is expecting another 16% adjusted EPS growth in fiscal 2022, which ended January 31, 2022. With these types of numbers, I think there's a good chance that Walmart will break its streak of 4 cent increases, and I also think the company will continue to focus on share buybacks. Expect an increase in the company's share buyback program when the company reports earnings in February.

Prediction: 1.8 - 3.6% increase to $2.24 - $2.28

Predicted Forward Yield: 1.67 - 1.70%

Summary

With at least 23 companies announcing in the first half of the month and then another 14 companies announcing in the latter half of the month, February is one of the busiest months for dividend increases. Notable increases in the first two weeks of February came from Exponent, Moody's, Corning, and T. Rowe Price. But the top story was a massive surprise from UPS - a 49% dividend increase.

The latter half of the month brings some modest boosts from some popular companies - Coca-Cola and Walmart come to mind - while some other companies are likely to announce some good-sized increases. I'm expecting double-digit increases from Best Buy and Home Depot, as well as the lesser-known Silgan. Most other increases in the second half of the month will be in the low-to-mid single digits."

While the Russian president made a display of his authority in a meeting of his Security Council at the Kremlin on Tuesday, intelligence suggests that elements within the Moscow establishment believe his military strike to be a mistake which could destabilise his 20-year rule.

The inner core of Putin’s administration are understood to expect that Russian troops will be welcomed by significant portions of the Ukrainian population, a belief which Western officials regard as a severe misjudgement.

Western officials said it was clear that Mr Putin was intent on securing control over a large section of Ukrainian territory and that he was also expected to try to seize capital Kyiv to install a pro-Moscow puppet government.

Faced with an attack on many fronts, Ukrainian forces face a challenging task to resist the significantly larger Russian military, much of it war-hardened from service in Syria, Crimea and Georgia.

Early missile strikes were targeted at Ukraine’s air defence system in a bid to secure Russian dominance of the skies to provide devastating support for ground forces.

But there are indications of Ukrainians mounting a defence against the onslaught, with at least one Russian aircraft believed to have been shot down this morning.

An eventual assault on Kyiv may come up against stiff resistance, potentially requiring protracted and bloody street-fighting to subdue, Western officials believe.

This map shows major cities in Ukraine as well as Moscow-backed separatist regions. As of early this week, rebels held only parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions highlighted (The Independent)

The history of Russia’s brutal approach to urban warfare in Chechnya – where much of capital Grozny was levelled to the ground – is prompting fears in Western capitals of significant civilian casualties in a no-holds-barred assault on the city of 3m people.

And there are concerns of a refugee crisis as Ukrainians flee the capital as well as other areas menaced by Russian forces.

Western officials said that this morning’s attack saw a combination of precision missile strikes and air strikes followed by an unknown numbers of Russian troops entering Ukrainian territory from Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and occupied Crimea to the south.

Special operations forces are believed to have moved into Ukraine in advance of the conventional forces in order to soften up opposition before the main assault.

And cyber attacks on Ukrainian financial institutions and government departments late last night are also thought to have been directed from Moscow.

The vast scale of the 200,000-strong force assembled by Putin in the region means it could be a matter of days before the full military strike is deployed.

It remains unclear whether Putin’s goal is to seize the entire 230,000 square miles of Ukrainian territory, or to focus on strategic priorities such as the Donbass region and the Black Sea ports of Mariupol and Odessa or to establish a “land bridge” between Crimea and Russian territory."

Americans in Russia have been told to make plans to evacuate that doesn't involve support from the U.S. government as Washington and the Kremlin tussle over a summit with President Biden and Vladimir Putin and intelligence warns 190,000 troops are ready to strike Ukraine.

The State Department cautioned Americans to flee Moscow and St. Petersburg, without the help of the U.S. government, amid warnings of terrorist attacks in the cities and warned U.S. citizens in Ukraine to get out as soon as possible because Moscow could 'severely restrict' air travel.

'According to media sources, there have been threats of attacks against shopping centers, railway and metro stations, and other public gathering places in major urban areas, including Moscow and St. Petersburg as well as in areas of heightened tension along the Russian border with Ukraine,' the warning issued on Sunday read.

Americans were told to avoid crowds, tell relatives if they are safe, carry around U.S. identification and 'have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance'.

In a separate warning for Americans in Ukraine, the State Department wrote: 'The security situation in Ukraine continues to be unpredictable throughout the country and may deteriorate with little notice. There is a strong likelihood that any Russian military operations would severely restrict commercial air travel.'

French President Emmanuel Macron said early Monday that he had suggested the summit to Putin and Biden to discuss 'security and strategic stability in Europe.'

'Presidents Biden and Putin have both accepted the principle of such a summit,' the French president said, before adding that such a meeting would be impossible if Russia invaded Ukraine as Western nations fear it plans.

The Kremlin on Monday morning downplayed the possibility of a summit next week - after the White House said that Biden had agreed 'in principle' to talks brokered by France, provided war did not break out in the meantime.

'As the President has repeatedly made clear, we are committed to pursuing diplomacy until the moment an invasion begins,' White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Sunday night.

She said that U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov are scheduled to meet first on February 24 in Europe to hammer out the terms of the confab between the two heads of state. After the Blinken/Lavrov pow-wow, the two presidents will meet if all goes well.

French President Emmanuel Macron hammered out a tentative meeting between President Biden and President Putin to discuss 'security and strategic stability in Europe.'

'President Biden accepted in principle a meeting with President Putin following that engagement, again, if an invasion hasn’t happened,' Psaki said.

'We are always ready for diplomacy. We are also ready to impose swift and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war. And currently, Russia appears to be continuing preparations for a full-scale assault on Ukraine very soon.

France's announcement - released after a volley of phone calls between Macron and leaders on both sides of the Atlantic - comes as the Biden administration scrambled Sunday following a US intelligence report that revealed Putin has 190,000 troops poised to roll over Ukraine.

Tensions have escalated in the last week during Russia's steady military buildup along the Ukrainian border. Ukraine has begged the West to act now and impose sanctions on Russia in response to sustained shelling by pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine.

US diplomat Bathsheba Nell Crocker penned a letter to the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights warning that Russia planned further human rights abuses in Ukraine if the invasion goes forward.

Vice President Kamala Harris warned about the 'real possibility of war in Europe' as sources alleged that Russian commanders on the ground have received orders to proceed with an invasion of Kiev, and that they're now making specific battle plans.

No less than 75 percent of Putin's conventional forces are now poised at the Ukrainian border as Blinken warned that 'we are on the brink of an invasion'.

Ongoing tensions prompted Biden to convene a National Security Meeting while Harris wrapped up a Munich Security Conference, where she called the situation a 'decisive moment' for world leaders who 'still sincerely hope that there is a diplomatic path out of this moment.'

President Joe Biden convened a meeting of the National Security Council on Sunday to discuss the latest developments regarding Russia's expected invasion of Ukraine

Vice President Kamala Harris told reporters in Munich on Sunday that there was a 'real possibility of war in Europe' as Russia appears posed for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine

Vice President Kamala Harris' Munich Security Conference remarks Well, this was an important trip to be here at the Munich Security Conference - in particular this year - as I said yesterday. We are looking at a moment that is a very decisive moment on one of the bases for the Munich Security Conference and certainly one of the founding reasons for NATO, which is European security and the connection and alliance between Europe and the United States. This was a productive trip, in terms of the extensive bilateral meetings that we had that were in furtherance of the ongoing collaboration and partnership with our Allies. It was important in that, as you all know, this is a moment that is very dynamic. If not every hour, certainly every day, there seem to be new moments of interest and also of intelligence. And so we have affirmed, however - all of that being said - through these last couple of days, that this Alliance is strong - probably stronger than it was before; and that this Alliance has purpose and meaning founded on shared principles that are very much at play right now. And as I mentioned yesterday, if we think about those principles, one of the most important is about a mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, which at its essence is what is at play in terms of Russia’s posture as it relates to Ukraine. At stake is the NATO Alliance, in terms of our unity, joining together - through, sometimes, compromise; certainly always through collaboration - to be a unified voice, especially when these very founding principles of our relationship are being compromised, if not attacked.

Biden was planning to travel to Delaware following Sunday's meeting, but abruptly canceled those plans and will remain in DC, the White House said.

It is thought Moscow will start the invasion with a cyber-assault before unleashing a campaign of missile and airstrikes before ground troops attempt to take Ukrainian cities and towns, CBS News reported. The invading Russian force reportedly has the ability to invade and take much of the country.

The Biden administration has promised to retaliate with sanctions against Russia, including barring U.S. financial institutions from processing transactions for major Russian banks, Reuters reported.

The US would block the flow of currency between specific US banks and Russian banks and target individuals and companies by placing them on the Specially Designated Nationals, effectively kicking them out of the banking system.

The dire warnings come as Putin and his ally Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko extended military drills in Belarus that were due to end on Sunday, meaning an estimated 30,000 Russian troops will remain there.

But the concentration of nearly 200,000 Russian soldiers, warplanes and equipment within striking distance of Ukraine – including as many as 500 fighter and fighter-bomber aircraft – is highly unusual and part of the reason Washington believes Russia is ready to attack, a US official told CNN.

Amid the soaring tensions Macron pleaded for peace from his Russian counterpart during a two-hour phone call today – but Putin blamed Ukrainian 'provocations' for the escalating crisis that could turn into all-out war.

A Russian invasion force of armored tanks painted with the letter 'Z' and huge convoys were seen rolling towards the Ukraine border - as the eastern region continues to be rocked by shelling and British expats have vowed to 'fight like devils'.

It is suspected the markings have been allocated for specific roles amid rising tensions over an imminent invasion, with footage showing the letters sprayed on tanks, self-propelled guns, fuel trucks and supply vehicles.

The U.S. embassy in Russia also cautioned Americans on Sunday to have evacuation plans ready.

'There have been threats of attacks against shopping centers, railway and metro stations, and other public gathering places in major urban areas, including Moscow and St. Petersburg as well as in areas of heightened tension along the Russian border with Ukraine,' the embassy said.

'Review your personal security plans,' the embassy said. 'Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance.'

Analysts seized on the idea of false flag terrorist attacks on Russian soil being used to justify an overwhelming attack on Ukraine.

No less than 75 per cent of Vladimir Putin's conventional forces are now poised at the Ukrainian border, it emerged tonight, as US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken warned that 'we are on the brink of an invasion'

It comes as Blinken said he believed Putin is 'moving forward' which his decision, a move the Kremlin has denied.

The concentration of Russian forces within striking distance of Ukraine – including as many as 500 fighter and fighter-bomber aircraft - is highly unusual and part of the reason the US believes Russia is ready to attack, a US official told CNN.

This includes some 120 of Russia's total estimated 160 Battalion Tactical Groups or BTGs which are positioned within 38 miles of Ukraine, according to the official. While that figure represents 75% of Russia's principal combat units, it is less than half of the total troops in the Russian military.

US officials have reported that Russian troops combined with separatist forces could number as high as 190,000 deployed around Ukraine.

Some 35 of 50 air defence battalions are deployed against Ukraine. In addition, the US estimates some 500 fighter and fighter-bomber aircraft are within range of Ukraine, as well as 50 medium to heavy bombers.

Together, the Russian forces now vastly outnumber Ukrainian military forces, according to the assessment. US officials estimate there are some 190,000 soldiers in and around Ukraine, including in the illegally annexed territory of Crimea, which was seized by Russia in 2014.

One British expat said he was part of a small community ready to help armed resistance volunteers and 'fight like devils' in the event of an invasion.

He told the BBC: 'We are here, we are ready to fight and we will fight like devils, I tell you. There is a small expat community here but we will join with our Ukrainian partners, our Ukrainian friends and Ukrainian family.'

Russia will also extend military drills in Belarus that were due to end on Sunday, the Belarusian defense ministry announced, in a step Blinken said made him more worried about an imminent invasion.

The defense ministry said the decision was taken because of military activity near the borders of Russia and Belarus as well as the situation in eastern Ukraine's Donbass region.

Sporadic shelling across the line dividing Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists in that region increased sharply last week and continued on Sunday.

Speaking to CNN, Blinken said all signs suggested Russia was about to invade. Russia has repeatedly denied such plans.

'Everything we are seeing suggests that this is dead serious, that we are on the brink of an invasion,' Blinken said, adding that the West was equally prepared if Moscow invades.

'Until the tanks are actually rolling, and the planes are flying, we will use every opportunity and every minute we have to see if diplomacy can still dissuade President (Vladimir) Putin from carrying this forward.'

Blinken told CBS: 'Everything we're seeing tells us that the decision we believe President Putin has made to invade is moving forward.

'We've seen that with provocations created by the Russians or separatist forces over the weekend, false flag operations, now the news just this morning that the 'exercises' Russia was engaged in in Belarus with 30,000 Russian forces that was supposed to end this weekend will now continue because of tensions in eastern Ukraine, tensions created by Russia and the separatist forces it backs there.'

But he rejected a plea from Ukraine for the West to act now against Moscow in an interview with the US broadcaster CNN.

'The purpose of the sanctions in the first instance is to try to deter Russia from going to war. As soon as you trigger them that deterrence is gone,' he said. Blinken is due to meet his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Thursday.

Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba had said sustained shelling by pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine in recent days needed an immediate response.

'Russia has to be stopped right now. We see how events are unfolding,' Kuleba told a security conference in Munich, where Western leaders had gathered to discuss the crisis. 'It's time to act. I'm officially saying that there are all the grounds to implement at least a part of sanctions prepared against Russia now.'

The Moscow apartment bombings in 1999 were an immediate prelude to a brutal Chechen war. Critics of Vladimir Putin have always maintained that the Russian state was behind the atrocities.

Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, questioned if the United States had passed on the information about possible attacks to Russia.

'And if not, how is one to understand all of this?' Zakharova said.

Meanwhile, the call between Macron and Putin on Sunday led to the leaders agreeing on 'the need to favour a diplomatic solution to the ongoing crisis and to do everything to achieve one.'

But during the call, Putin told the French leader that Western countries should give point-by-point responses to sweeping demands set by Moscow last December to limit the West's role in eastern Europe and ex-Soviet countries

The Kremlin said the supply of weapons and ammunition by NATO countries to Ukraine was pushing Kyiv towards a 'military solution' against separatists in the country's east.

'As a result, civilians... who have to evacuate to Russia to escape the intensifying shelling, suffer,' the Kremlin added.

Explosions late on Saturday shook eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting the pro-Russia rebels since 2014 in a conflict that has killed some 14,000 people.

Hundreds of artillery shells have exploded along the contact line between Ukrainian soldiers and Russia-backed separatists, further increasing fears that the volatile region could see a Russian invasion.

Ukraine and the separatist leaders traded accusations of escalation. Russia on Saturday said at least two shells fired from a government-held part of eastern Ukraine landed across the border, but Ukraine's foreign minister dismissed that claim as 'a fake statement.'

'When tension is escalated to the maximum, as it is now, for example, on the line of contact, then any spark, any unplanned incident or any minor planned provocation can lead to irreparable consequences,' Putin' spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview that aired Sunday on Russian state television.

On the front lines, Ukrainian soldiers said they were under orders not to return fire. Zahar Leshushun, peering into the distance with a periscope, had followed the news all day from a trench where he is posted near the town of Zolote.

'Right now, we don't respond to their fire because...' the Ukrainian soldier said before being interrupted by the sound of an incoming shell. 'Oh! They are shooting at us now. They are aiming at the command post.'

Thousands of civilians have been evacuated from increasingly barraged front line regions, where Kyiv said two of its soldiers had died in an attack yesterday - the first fatalities in the conflict for more than a month.

Separatist leaders have ordered a full military mobilization and sent more civilians to Russia, which has issued about 700,000 passports to residents of the rebel-held territories. Claims that Russian citizens are being endangered might be used as justification for military action.

Sporadic violence has broken out for years along the line separating Ukrainian forces from the Russia-backed separatists, but the spike in recent days is orders of magnitude higher than anything recently recorded by international monitors: nearly 1,500 explosions in 24 hours.

Denis Pushilin, the head of the pro-Russia separatist government in Ukraine's Donetsk region, cited an 'immediate threat of aggression' from Ukrainian forces in his announcement of a call to arms. Ukrainian officials vehemently denied having plans to take rebel-controlled areas by force.

Home Secretary warns UK interests could be targeted by Russian hackers as GCHQ tells firms and public services to take 'pre-emptive measures' to defend themselves British firms and public services should brace themselves for cyber attacks as tensions with Russia escalate over a potential invasion of Ukraine. In a stark warning, Home Secretary Priti Patel urged organisations to take 'pre-emptive measures' against 'cyber attacks aimed at the West'. Lindy Cameron, head of Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ (GCHQ) national cyber security centre, also described a 'heightened cyber threat', the Sunday Telegraph reports. The heads of food, utility and communications companies have been briefed by GCHQ director Jeremy Fleming and told to strengthen their cyber defences. Advertisement

Putin and Macron said during their phone call they would work 'intensely' to allow the Trilateral Contact Group, which includes Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, to meet 'in the next few hours with the aim of getting all interested parties to commit to a ceasefire at the contact line' in eastern Ukraine where government troops and pro-Russian separatists are facing each other.

'Intense diplomatic work will take place in the coming days,' Macron's office said, with several consultations to take place in the French capital.

Macron and Putin also agreed that talks between Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany should resume to implement the so-called Minsk protocol, which in 2014 had already called for a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine.

Both also agreed to work towards 'a high-level meeting with the aim of defining a new peace and security order in Europe', Macron's office said.

In Sunday's call, Putin told Macron that he intends to withdraw Russian troops from Belarus as soon as ongoing military exercises there are over, the Elysee also said.

The French presidency said that this claim 'will have to be verified', adding it appeared to contradict a statement by the Belarusian government that the Russian military would 'continue inspections' beyond Sunday's previously announced end of the exercises, leaving Moscow with a large force near the northern Ukrainian border.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the phone call between Macron and Putin, where the Russian leader agreed on the 'need to favor a diplomatic solution' to the ongoing crisis, was a 'welcome sign'.

Johnson and Macron later agreed during a phone call on Sunday that the next week will be 'crucial for diplomacy' as the West looks to avert war between Russia and Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Russia on Sunday night issued a NOTAM (Notice to airmen), declaring the Sea of Azov a no-fly zone for commercial flights. The area concerned bordered the crucial Ukrainian port of Mariupol, which is close to the line of contact between Ukraine's and the pro-Russian forces.

The move was seen as a possible precursor to a seaborne invasion of Ukraine from the flotilla of six massive landing ships which the Russian Navy has amassed in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, each of which can carry ten main battle tanks and 300 troops.

The vessels and their deadly cargo would open up yet another line of attack for the Russians alongside their massive troop build-ups already in place on Ukraine's eastern and northern borders.

The ships, all part of Russia's Northern and Baltic Fleets, made the tortuous journey around western Europe, through the Strait of Gibraltar and right across the Mediterranean.

It came as a Russian invasion force of armored tanks painted with the letter 'Z' and huge convoys were seen rolling towards the Ukraine border in Shebekino, Russia.

Around 200 military vehicles were spotted in Shebekino, just across the border from Ukraine's Kharkiv Oblast, with 'Z' markings 'applied hastily' to the backs of most vehicles.

Independent Russian Telegram channel Hunter's Notes, which closely monitors military movements, said 'all equipment [marked with 'Z'] was seen near Kursk and in the Shebekino region of Belgorod' on the border with Ukraine.

The tactic mirrors that used by UK and US forces in the First Gulf War when the allied invasion sent to liberate Kuwait marked vehicles with a distinctive upturned chevron [^] to avoid friendly fire once action begins.

The Ukraine War Report account on Twitter, which posts about Russian troop movements near Ukraine, said: 'Numerous videos are being uploaded of Russian military vehicles with 'Z' markings. Our assessment is it's 'friend or foe' identification markings used by armies during wartime.'

Military analyst Rob Lee wrote on Twitter: 'It appears Russian forces near the border are painting markers, in this case 'Z', on vehicles to identify different task forces or echelons.'

'It would suggest final preparations are complete,' a source in Ukraine told The Sun. 'The Ukrainians have very similar tanks and vehicles and [the Russians] will want to reduce the risk of friendly fire.'

It was suggested Russian troops also have the letter 'Z' on their military packs, which could support the friendly fire theory.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for Vladimir Putin to meet him for talks amid the escalating crisis, saying 'I don't know what the president of the Russian Federation wants', but that Ukraine would continue 'to follow only the diplomatic path'.

The Kremlin insists it has no incursion plans, but its test-firing of nuclear-capable missiles Saturday did little to alleviate tensions.

British and US intelligence has also suggested that Putin has already issued a 'go' order to trigger his invasion plan.

It is expected that Russia will follow false flag operations and brushes with Ukrainian military in the Donbas region with an attack led by separatist groups, before Russian troops 'take a bite out of Ukraine' or launch a full invasion, The Sunday Times reports.

A security source added: 'I would expect a massive opening salvo to try to remove the government in Kyiv. The Russians have positioned cruise missiles to take out the capital.'

Dmitry Polyanskiy, the first deputy permanent representative of Russia to the United Nations, has also accused the West of 'warmongering' by creating an 'artificial crisis' in Ukraine.

He told Sky News' Trevor Phillips On Sunday program that Moscow had the 'right to be concerned' by the placement of Nato infrastructure and troops 'near our border'.

President Zelenskyy made his plea for talks with Putin hours after separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine ordered a full military mobilization and Western leaders warned a Russian invasion of its neighbor appeared imminent.

However, Belarusian Defence Minister Victor Khrenin has confirmed that joint exercises involving Russia and Belarus forces are being extended, despite promises from Moscow that the drills would end this weekend.

He said: 'The presidents of Belarus and Russia decided to continue inspections of the readiness of Union State forces.'

Khrenin added that the decision was taken due to increased military activity along the Belarusian and Russian borders and because of an 'escalation' in east Ukraine.

The drills in Belarus - which had been due to conclude Sunday - have exacerbated already soaring tensions.

The Belarus defence ministry said upcoming stages of the large-scale drills would continue the aim of ensuring a sufficient military response to any external threats. It did not specify an end date.

The Kremlin insists it has no incursion plans, but its test-firing of nuclear-capable missiles Saturday did little to alleviate tensions. Russia has also been holding joint exercises with Belarus at a firing range near Brest (pictured)

In new signs of fears that a war could start within days, Germany and Austria told their citizens to leave Ukraine. German air carrier Lufthansa cancelled flights to the capital Kyiv and to Odessa, a Black Sea port that could be a key target in an invasion.

At the same time, pro-Russian social media accounts claimed the Ukrainian military was planning a huge offensive in the war-torn eastern region of Donbas.

Fears of tensions boiling over were backed up by figures released Saturday by the OSCE, which showed there were more than 1,400 explosions in the rebel held regions of Donetsk and Luhansk on Friday.

The OSCE's Special Monitoring Mission that is deployed in the conflict zone said it had logged 553 explosions in Donetsk and a further 860 in neighbouring Luhansk - adding that it had confirmed one civilian casualty in a government-controlled area of Donetsk.

It put the total number of ceasefire violations on Friday at more than 1,500, compared with 870 the day before, suggesting an upwards trajectory of gunfire and mortars.

Ukraine's Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskiy experienced the clashes first-hand Saturday, ducking for cover as mortar shells fell within a few hundred metres of him while he toured the frontline with reporters.

It came as US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said on Saturday during a visit to Lithuania that Russian troops dotted along Ukraine's border are 'uncoiling' and 'poised to strike'.

The origin of the explosions over the weekend are not clear, while there was no immediate comment from separatist authorities or from Kyiv.

Last-ditch diplomatic efforts were underway on Sunday to prevent what Western powers warn a catastrophic European war as Macron was to call his Putin as ceasefire monitors and Ukrainian commanders reported intense shelling in eastern Ukraine.

Macron met Putin on February 7 and has since, along with fellow Western leaders like Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz, been urging his Russian counterpart to pull back from the brink of war.

Sunday's call, Macron's office said, represented 'the last possible and necessary effort to avoid a major conflict in Ukraine'.

But in a new suspected stunt the pro-Moscow rebel authority in Donetsk claim to have detained a Ukrainian spy who was said to be confessing to Kyiv's aims to overrun the Donbas.

Anton Matsanyuk is alleged to have 'confirmed that Kyiv intends to use all its strike power in the forcible seizure of the Donbas', one report said.

The alleged saboteur conveniently confirmed a plan touted in recent days by Russia of a Ukrainian plan to invade Donetsk and Luhansk.

This detailed offensive plan, which fell into the hands of Donetsk intelligence officers, was broadcast by Channel One.

He was also linked to a plan to blow up the car belonging to Denis Sinenkov, the head of the people's militia directorate of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), said Russian TV. The car was blown up in what the West say was a false flag operation on February 18.

Russian TV claimed Matsanyuk had access to classified information on Donetsk leaders, and that it was by 'sheer luck' Sinenkov was not inside his vehicle.

'I was recruited in 2018', he said as he claimed he was an agent of Ukrainian military intelligence.

Matsanyuk was allegedly forming a 'sleeping cell' to stage 'terrorist attacks' on orders from Ukraine.

In a claimed confession, he said: 'When the 'H-Hour' comes, they will be instructed to place the caches with improvised explosive devices [IEDs], so that in the future these IEDs will be installed in critical facilities of the DPR; these are bridges, this is a crowd of people, these are railway crossings, also on the routes of the first people in the republic and against military motorcades.'

It comes after Jens Stoltenberg, NATO chief, warned that the risk of a Russian attack is 'very high', echoing US warnings that Russian troops dotted along Ukraine's border are 'uncoiling' and 'poised to strike'.

'Every indication indicates that Russia is planning a full-fledged attack against Ukraine,' Stoltenberg told German broadcaster ARD on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.

'We all agree that the risk of an attack is very high.'

The United States dominates NATO, and US President Joe Biden on Friday said he was 'convinced' Russia was going to invade Ukraine within the week, and have its forces target Ukraine's capital Kyiv.

The US recently sent nearly 5,000 troops to NATO ally Poland, in addition to the 4,000 that are on a permanent rotation in the country. The aim is to reassure a nervous ally amid fears that Russia could attack Ukraine.

'The safety of our personnel is paramount, so staff have been relocated to Lviv and Brussels. The NATO offices in Ukraine remain operational,' the official told AFP, without giving numbers.

Meanwhile, pro-Kremlin channel NTV has revealed that Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov personally ordered a leak damaging to 'insolent' Foreign Secretary Liz Truss immediately after their talks in Moscow earlier this month.

He did so because Ms Truss showed herself to be 'a fool, and so arrogant at the same time', it was claimed in a new attack on the Tory politician who has become a Moscow target for her forthright views.

Kommersant newspaper journalist Maxim Yusin revealed his paper was leaked an apparent blunder by Truss during the talks in confusing two regions in Russia - Voronezh and Rostov - with Ukrainian regions.

He said: 'This exchange [with Ms Truss] happened in closed negotiations. Were it not for Lavrov [deciding to leak], and sharing it with Kommersant, nobody would know about [her confusing Ukrainian and Russian regions].

'I have no doubt there were a lot of blunders when Lavrov was talking to [German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock] who is not much smarter than this madam [Truss] - but [Baerbock] didn't behave as insolently and arrogantly.

'This is why neither her nor other interlocutors of Lavrov who slipped up became victims of making [their blunders] public. [With Truss] one can't be a fool, and so arrogant at the same time. It's either, or.'

In the talks, Lavrov had insisted that Russia had every right to move its armed forces on its own territory.

But Ms Truss repeated that they should be withdrawn and Lavrov countered - according to Kommersant newspaper: 'Do you recognise the sovereignty of Russia over the Rostov and Voronezh regions?'

She allegedly replied after a short pause: 'Britain will never recognize Russian sovereignty over these regions.'

At this, British ambassador Deborah Bronnert was forced to intervene to correct Truss and explain that these were Russian - not Ukrainian - regions, according to the accounts in Moscow.

Meanwhile, Putin put on a show of military strength today with huge new nuclear drills involving ballistic missiles, submarines, tank convoys and ship-based missiles.

In a released photo, the Russian president and Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko - often dubbed the 'Europe's last dictator' - can be seen watching the sabre-rattling drills from a situation room in the Kremlin.

It came as world leaders gathered at the Munich Security Conference in Germany today - where Boris Johnson warned a Russian invasion of Ukraine could cause 'the destruction of a democratic state', adding that 'the shock will echo around the world'.

The Prime Minister said the 'omens are grim' from Russia on the possibility of an invasion in the coming days, and that the world could not 'underestimate the gravity of this moment'.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told Western powers at the conference to stop their 'appeasement' of Russia and warned sanctions will not work on Moscow once the bombing starts - which earned him a standing ovation from world leaders.

The conference had echoes of the 1938 summit in Munich in which leaders agreed a policy of appeasement against Adolf Hitler's Germany in an effort to prevent an imminent war.

Zelensky said today: 'Ukraine has received security guarantees for abandoning the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal. We have no weapons. And no security ...

'But we have a right - a right to demand a shift from a policy of appeasement to one ensuring security and peace.'

He added: 'For eight years, Ukraine has been a shield. For eight years, Ukraine has been holding back one of the greatest armies in the world.'

Foreign ministers from the G7 group of rich nations said on Saturday they saw no evidence that Russia is reducing military activity near Ukraine's borders and remain 'gravely concerned' about the situation.

'We call on Russia to choose the path of diplomacy, to de-escalate tensions, to substantively withdraw military forces from the proximity of Ukraine's borders and to fully abide by international commitments,' the countries said in a joint statement released by Britain's foreign ministry.

'As a first step, we expect Russia to implement the announced reduction of its military activities along Ukraine's borders. We have seen no evidence of this reduction,' they added.

Elsewhere, NATO is relocating staff from Kyiv to Lviv, in the west of the country, and to the Belgian capital Brussels, for their safety, an alliance official said Saturday.

Ukraine is not a member of NATO, and the alliance does not have any forces there, but since the late 1990s it has maintained two offices in Kyiv - a NATO Liaison Office and a NATO Information and Documentation Centre.

The liaison office's job is keep up dialogue between NATO and Ukraine's government while encouraging a democratic transformation of Ukraine's defense and security sector.

According to NATO's website, it consisted of a civilian head leading a mixed team of NATO military and civilian personnel. The web page, last updated in 2016, said there were a total of 16 staff.

The NATO Information and Documentation Centre's number of personnel was not disclosed. Its job was to inform the Ukrainian public about NATO and support Ukrainian institutions in their communications.

Stoltenberg has previously said that the alliance will not deploy any forces into Ukraine to defend it from any Russian aggression.

But NATO members have sent forces to neighbouring countries which are alliance members, and Stoltenberg has said NATO member countries will vigorously react to any Russian action in those territories, under its collective defence pact.

It comes as the Russians are continuing their 'false flag' operations in Eastern Ukraine, seemingly designed to provoke conflict.

Thousands of Ukrainian refugees are starting to stream into Russia today after Vladimir Putin's allies ordered a mass evacuation of two separatist republics as part of a suspected 'false flag' operation to provide the pretext for an invasion.

Up to 700,000 civilians are being evacuated from the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk after rebel leaders yesterday claimed Ukraine was about to attack the areas.

Hours later, a car bomb rocked Donetsk in an alleged 'assassination attempt' of a top Putin-allied official, which Western intelligence agencies believe was faked as part of the 'false flag' deception.

Later two explosions at a 'gas pipeline' rocked the separatist city of Luhansk in eastern Ukraine in another suspected false flag attack.

Elsewhere, the Russian leader is personally overseeing nuclear exercises involving 'strategic forces' which will include practice launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles and cruise missiles.

The Kremlin nuclear drills also involved Mig fighter bombers armed with hypersonic missiles patrolling over the Mediterranean from their bases in Syria.

Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko is joining Putin in the situation room in the Kremlin to watch over the strategic drills.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said today's drills 'should not cause anyone concern' and said Russia had informed the proper channels.

Russia holds huge strategic drills every year but today's manoeuvres include the Black Sea Fleet, based on the Crimean Peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.

Meanwhile, top Ukrainian military officials came under a shelling attack during a tour of the front of the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine and were forced to flee to a bomb shelter before leaving the area.

Russia has also sent a MIG-31K and a Tu-22M3 bomber over the Mediterranean in another show of force amid the rising tensions.

The warplane is deployed with the new ultra high speed Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missiles.

The 24-foot-long, one-ton Kinzhal - or Dagger - can carry conventional or nuclear warheads, and Russia boasts it has no match among Western defences.

The hypersonic Kinzhal has a range of 1,250 miles and could pummel Ukrainian troops and defences without flying close to the country.

Russia is believed to have around 20 Kinzhal-compatible MiG-31Ks in total.

Video footage has also emerged which graphically demonstrates the sheer intensity of the bombardment that Russian-backed forces have unleashed on Ukraine in the last two days.

In night-time footage taken from the port city of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov, just a few miles from the front line, shells could be heard raining down almost incessantly on Ukrainian positions for five hours.

The distant flashes from the exploding 122mm and 152mm heavy artillery and mortars on the video posted on censor.net were reminiscent of WW1 trench warfare.

One resident of the city posted on Facebook: 'No-one in Mariupol is sleeping tonight.'

According to the Ukrainian government there were a total of 66 ceasefire violations by the pro-Russian rebels overnight, involving hundreds of shells.

In a separate incident at a front-line checkpoint at Schastia, which ironically means 'Happiness' in Ukrainian, more incoming shells blasted onto a car park in daytime CCTV footage provided by the Ukraine government.

Shelling also damaged a pumping station in Donetsk Oblast, threatening water supply to 46 towns and villages in the Ukrainian-controlled parts of the region, Ukraine's authorities reported.

Amid the new drills today, US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin said the troops on the border are 'uncoiling' and 'poised to strike' during a visit to Lithuania.

'They are uncoiling and are now poised to strike,' he said, adding that troops were 'moving into the right kinds of positions to be able to conduct an attack'.

Meanwhile Boris Johnson warned an invasion of Ukraine could cause 'the destruction of a democratic state' and 'the shock will echo around the world'.

Speaking at the Munich Security Conference today, the prime minister said the 'omens are grim' from Russia on the possibility of an invasion in the coming days, and that the world could not 'underestimate the gravity of this moment'.

He jetted to the annual summit in Bavaria to make a plea to avoid 'unnecessary bloodshed' by diplomatic means if the West speaks with 'one voice'.

In a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Johnson said: 'If Ukraine is invaded and if Ukraine is overwhelmed, we will witness the destruction of a democratic state, a country that has been free for a generation, with a proud history of elections.

Thousands of Ukrainian refugees are streaming into Russia today after Putin's allies ordered a mass evacuation

It comes as thousands of Ukrainian refugees are streaming into Russia today after Putin's allies ordered a mass evacuation of two separatist republics as part of a suspected 'false flag' operation to provide the pretext for an invasion.

Up to 700,00 civilians are being evacuated from the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk after rebel leaders yesterday claimed Ukraine was about to attack the areas.

Hours later a car bomb rocked Donetsk in an alleged 'assassination attempt' of a top Putin-allied official, which Western intelligence agencies believe was faked as part of the 'false flag' deception.

Later two explosions at a 'gas pipeline' rocked the separatist city of Luhansk in eastern Ukraine in another suspected false flag attack.

Last night, US President said he is 'convinced' the Russian premier has made up his mind to launch an invasion after amassing almost 200,000 troops on the border.

In a televised address from the White House, Biden said he has 'reason to believe' it will occur in the 'coming days' and will include an assault on the capital Kyiv.

After weeks of saying the US was not sure if Putin had made the final decision to launch a widespread invasion, Biden said that assessment had changed.

'As of this moment I'm convinced he's made the decision,' Biden said. 'We have reason to believe that.'

He cited the United States' 'significant intelligence capability' for the assessment.

The Ukrainian civilian refugees will be housed in tent cities provided by Putin's government in Russia where they will receive a gift of $132.

False flag suspicions were also fueled by time stamps on the videos announcing the evacuations, that show they were taped by rebel leaders two days before being released.

Huge convoys of buses were laid on the for the refugees, after the evacuation was announced in video addresses by the leaders of the breakaway Republics which have also ordered a general mobilization of all men to the army.

Multiple explosions could be heard on Saturday morning in the north of the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, a Reuters witness said. The origin was not immediately clear. Ukraine said earlier that one of its soldiers had been killed.

Denis Pushilin, the leader of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic, has called on all men 'who are in the reserves to come to military conscription offices' following a mass evacuation of women and children in Ukraine's breakaway provinces to southern Russia.

Leonid Pasechnik, the leader of the Luhansk separatist region in Ukraine, ordered a general mobilisation shortly afterwards.

Pushilin claimed his region's forces had prevented attacks he said were planned by Ukraine, and that the Ukrainian army had continued manoeuvres.

Separatist authorities on Friday announced plans to evacuate around 700,000 people, citing fears of an imminent attack by Ukrainian forces – an accusation Kiev flatly denied.

Less than 7,000 people had been evacuated from Donetsk as of Saturday morning, the local emergencies ministry said.

The Ukrainian military said it had recorded 12 ceasefire violations by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in the morning after 66 cases in the previous 24 hours. Separatist authorities also reported what they said was shelling by Ukrainian forces of several villages on Saturday. Both sides regularly trade blame for ceasefire violations.

Kiev has repeatedly denied any plans to regain control of separatist-held areas using force, including the Crimean peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014. More than 14,000 people have been killed in fighting between Ukraine's army and Russia's proxies.

It comes as Ukraine's army claimed today a soldier had been killed in the separatist east and Volodymyr Zelensky is heading to the Munich Security Conference, despite President Joe Biden's warning not to leave Ukraine through fear of an imminent invasion.

Yesterday Biden said he is now 'convinced' Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine and assault the capital.

After weeks of saying that Washington was not sure if Putin had made the final decision, the US President said that his judgment had changed, citing American intelligence. He reiterated that the assault could occur in the 'coming days'.

His comments followed a day of rising violence that included a humanitarian convoy hit by shelling and a car bombing in the eastern city of Donetsk.

Pro-Russian rebels began evacuating civilians from the conflict zone with an announcement that appeared to be part of Moscow's efforts to paint Ukraine as the aggressor instead.

One of Vladimir Putin's closest allies, parliament speaker Vyacheslav Volodin vowed that Russia would 'defend' its compatriots in the Donbas, hinting at military intervention.

He said: 'Russia doesn't want war.

'Our president Vladimir Putin repeatedly said this earlier and is saying this these days.'

But 'if danger arises to the lives of Russians and compatriots living in the DPR and LPR, our country will defend them.'

This came as pro-Moscow rebels claimed a water-pumping station in Vasilievka was hit by Ukrainian fire.

Ukraine has denied any such attacks.

Meanwhile, the Kremlin has announced massive nuclear drills to flex its military muscle, and Putin pledged to protect Russia's national interests against what it sees as encroaching Western threats.

Biden reiterated his threat of crushing economic and diplomatic sanctions against Russia if it does invade, and pressed Putin to reconsider. He said the US and its Western allies were more united than ever to ensure Russia pays a steep price for any invasion.

He said: 'We're calling out Russia's plans. Not because we want a conflict, but because we are doing everything in our power to remove any reason Russia may give to justify invading Ukraine.

'If Russia pursues its plans, it will be responsible for a catastrophic and needless war of choice.'

Earlier on Friday, Biden said he believed Putin had already made up his mind to invade Ukraine.

He said: 'As of this moment, I'm convinced he's made the decision. We have reason to believe that.'

He said it was based on Washington's 'significant intelligence capability.' But he insisted Putin could change course if he wanted to.

'Russia can still choose diplomacy,' he said. 'It is not too late to de-escalate and return to the negotiating table.'

As further indication that the Russians are preparing for a major military push, a US defense official said an estimated 40 per cent to 50 per cent of the ground forces deployed in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border have moved into attack positions closer to the border.

That shift has been under way for about a week, other officials have said, and does not necessarily mean Putin has decided to begin an invasion.

The official also said the number of Russian ground units known as battalion tactical groups in the border area had grown to as many as 125, up from 83 two weeks ago. Each group has 750 to 1,000 soldiers.

Lines of communication remain open. The US and Russian defence chiefs spoke on Friday, and US secretary of state Antony Blinken and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov agreed to meet next week.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will attend the Munich Security Conference on Saturday and return home later the same day, a statement from his office said.

Zelenskiy's trip had been under scrutiny due to concern in Western countries that Russia is poised to launch a military offensive against Ukraine and could do so while the president is out of the country.

The Russian defense ministry extended its military drills on Sunday, with some involving its strategic nuclear forces.

Putin observed the drills involving multiple practice launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles and cruise missiles in a demonstration that Russia remains a nuclear superpower.

The Russian leader has insisted that the large-scale military exercises with Belarusian forces close to the Ukrainian border are 'purely defensive' and do not represent a threat to any other country.

The blast, which was first reported by Russian state media, is thought to be the start of Putin's long-predicted false flag operation used to justify an invasion of the country

There are concerns among western allies that the Kremlin could use disinformation and a possible 'false flag' operation to justify an offensive, particularly with growing activity in separatist-held areas of Ukraine.

Putin will hold a telephone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday as tensions spike in the crisis over Ukraine, Moscow said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the call was 'on the president's schedule'.

With an estimated 190,000 Russian troops now posted around Ukraine's borders, the long-simmering separatist conflict could provide the spark for a broader attack.

Fears of such escalation intensified amid Friday's violence. A bombing struck a car outside the main government building in the rebel-held city of Donetsk. The head of the separatist forces, Denis Sinenkov, said the car was his, the Interfax news agency reported. There were no reports of casualties and no independent confirmation of the circumstances of the blast.

Shelling and shooting are common along the line that separates Ukrainian forces and the rebels, but targeted violence is unusual in rebel-held cities.

Adding to the tensions, two explosions shook the rebel-controlled city of Luhansk early on Saturday. The Luhansk Information Centre said one of the blasts was in a natural gas main and cited witnesses as saying the other was at a vehicle service station.

There was no immediate word on injuries or a cause. Luhansk officials blamed a gas main explosion earlier in the week on sabotage.

Monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe reported more than 600 explosions in the war-torn east of Ukraine on Friday.

Separatists in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions that form Ukraine's industrial heartland known as the Donbas announced they were evacuating civilians to Russia.

Pushilin said women, children and the elderly would go first, and that Russia has prepared facilities for them. He alleged in a video statement that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky was going to order an imminent offensive in the area.

Metadata from two videos posted by the separatists announcing the evacuation show that the files were created two days ago.

US authorities have alleged that the Kremlin's disinformation campaign could include staged, pre-recorded videos.

Authorities began moving children from an orphanage in Donetsk, and other residents boarded buses for Russia. Long lines formed at gas stations as more people prepared to leave on their own.

Putin has ordered the government to offer a payment of 10,000 rubles (about £95) to each evacuee, equivalent to about half of an average monthly salary in the war-ravaged Donbas region.

By Saturday morning, more than 6,600 residents of the rebel-controlled areas were evacuated to Russia, according to separatist officials, who have announced plans to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people.

The explosions and the announced evacuations were in line with US warnings of so-called false flag attacks that Russia could use to justify an invasion.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the threat to global security is 'more complex and probably higher' than during the Cold War.

He told a security conference in Munich that a small mistake or miscommunication between major powers could have catastrophic consequences.

Russia announced this week that it was pulling back forces from vast military exercises, but US officials said they saw no sign of a pullback and instead observed more troops moving toward the border with Ukraine.

Ukraine's president has called on the West to stop their 'appeasement' of Russia and warned sanctions will not work on Moscow once the bombing starts, to a standing ovation from world leaders.

Volodymyr Zelensky told a security forum in Munich that his country deserves stronger international support after acting as a buffer against Russian expansion.

The conference had echoes of the 1938 summit in Munich in which leaders agreed a policy of appeasement against Adolf Hitler's Germany in an effort to prevent an imminent war.

Zelensky said today: 'Ukraine has received security guarantees for abandoning the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal. We have no weapons. And no security ...

'But we have a right - a right to demand a shift from a policy of appeasement to one ensuring security and peace.'

He added: 'For eight years, Ukraine has been a shield. For eight years, Ukraine has been holding back one of the greatest armies in the world.'

What happened at the 1938 Munich conference? The Munich Agreement was signed by Neville Chamberlain, Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler and Edouard Daladier in 1938. It was designed to stop Germany invading Czechoslovakia. The agreement by the leaders agreed the annexation of Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland, occupied mainly by German speaking people. Upon his return home, Chamberlain declared the agreement had secured 'peace in our time'. However a year later Hitler invaded Poland, sparking the beginning of the Second World War. Advertisement

Zelensky also said he wants a 'clear' timeframe for when Ukraine can join the NATO alliance.

'What can we do? We can continue forcefully supporting Ukraine and its defences. Present... clear, feasible timeframes for membership of the Alliance,' he said.

The president also called for a meeting with Putin in order to avoid any conflict.

He said: 'I do not know what the Russian president wants. For this reason, I propose that we meet.'

Zelensky was warned not to travel to Munich today through fear that Russia may launch an attack in his absence.

Putin is putting on a show of military strength with new nuclear drills as he sends a MIG armed with a hypersonic missile over the Mediterranean.

The Russian leader is personally overseeing the nuclear exercises involving 'strategic forces' which will include practice launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles and cruise missiles.

Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko is joining Putin in the situation room in the Kremlin to watch over the strategic drills.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said today's drills 'should not cause anyone concern' and said Russia had informed the proper channels.

Russia holds huge strategic drills every year but today's manoeuvres include the Black Sea Fleet, based on the Crimean Peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.

Russia has also sent a MIG-31K and a Tu-22M3 bomber over the Mediterranean in another show of force amid the rising tensions.

The warplane is deployed with the new ultra high speed Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missiles.

The 24-foot-long, one-ton Kinzhal - or Dagger - can carry conventional or nuclear warheads, and Russia boasts it has no match among Western defences.

The hypersonic Kinzhal has a range of 1,250 miles and could pummel Ukrainian troops and defences without flying close to the country.

Russia is believed to have around 20 Kinzhal-compatible MiG-31Ks in total."

Last year, Black and Latino individuals experienced 2.9 and 3-year declines in life expectancy respectively, largely due to Covid-19 deaths. That is roughly 2.5 times the decline for white individuals.

As the Omicron variant continues to spread and we wait for this most recent wave to break, it is crucial that we not only recognize the racial differences in Covid-19 cases and deaths thus far but also begin to understand the underlying mechanisms that give rise to these disparities. In a recent report written with Andre Perry and Carl Romer, we explore the causes of Covid-19 racial disparities using a social determinants of health framework. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) defines the social determinants of health as “the conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks.” These social determinants are downstream of policy decisions that give shape to these conditions—decisions known as structural or political determinants.

Anthony Barr Research Assistant - Brookings Metro Ariel Gelrud Shiro Senior Research Assistant - Center on Children and Families

As David Dawes, from the Morehouse School of Medicine, explains in his recent book on the subject, “political determinants of health involve the systematic process of structuring relationships, distributing resources, and administrating power.” In our report, we discuss several key social determinants that are contributing to racial disparities in cases and deaths. Here, we focus on three—health care access and insurance, environmental exposure, and food access and nutrition. We briefly summarize the evidence for each determinant’s contribution to health disparities and propose policy solutions that could help reduce racial inequities by addressing underlying structural issues.

health care access and insurance

Latinos are three times more likely to not have health insurance than white Americans. For Black individuals, that number is 1.7. As we’ve noted previously, health and health care have a bidirectional relationship. “Poor health care leads to poor health, which then makes health care more expensive and less accessible.” This is especially true in the context of the pandemic. A recent study finds a strong negative correlation between a county’s insured rate and its number of Covid-19 cases and deaths. Furthermore, for individuals who get severe cases of Covid-19 and need medical attention, those without insurance often pay more money out of pocket for treatment due to how the CARES Act’s reimbursement program is structured.

The racial gaps in health insurance rates may also be contributing to disparities in Covid-19 outcomes through their effect on vaccine access. While much has been written about the ways in which Republican messaging is contributing to vaccine hesitancy, an often overlooked determinant of vaccination status is health insurance coverage. Among 25 different socioeconomic groups including gender, race, income level, and political affiliation, the group with the lowest vaccination rate is uninsured individuals under 65.

To reduce racial disparities in Covid-19 outcomes and future health outcomes, we need to improve health care access for Black and Latino communities. Some policies to improve access include:

Expand Medicaid and create federal fallback that guarantees coverage for people in the “coverage gap” meaning those who are below the federal poverty line but are not eligible for Medicaid. This is particularly important because individuals in the coverage gap are disproportionately Black and Latino.

Remove immigration-related requirements for Medicaid eligibility.

Implement temporary paid sick leave specific to Covid-19 either at the federal or state

Environmental exposure and air pollution

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emphasizes fair treatment in its definition of environmental justice. “No group of people should bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental consequences resulting from industrial, governmental and commercial operations or policies.” Unfortunately, we routinely fail to achieve this aspiration, often due to the lingering effects of entrenched racism. For example, a recent study of 108 U.S. urban areas finds that places that were formerly discriminated against via redlining and other housing policies are now disproportionately exposed to heat waves due to a lack of greenspace.

In the context of Covid-19, a respiratory virus, air pollution is the form of environmental exposure most relevant for explaining some of the disparities in death rates. Indeed, a preprint study from medRxiv finds strong correlations between levels of air pollution and Covid-19 death rates. Here too, environmental injustice produces disparate outcomes across races. For instance, prior research from the American Medical Association documents growing differences in air quality and respiratory health across neighborhoods with different socioeconomic compositions. The data suggests that while air quality varies across income levels, it varies more widely by race. We find that there is a greater correlation between the presence of respiratory hazards in a neighborhood and the size of Black/Hispanic populations than the correlation between those hazards and income and poverty. And recent research has found that communities of color are disproportionately harmed by air pollution even though their consumption contributes significantly less to emissions than both the national average and the average for white communities.

The decisions about where to locate trash incinerators, factories, interstate highways, or other potential hazards are policy decisions whose structural impact gives rise to disparate social conditions. There are at least two ways we can begin to address these injustices through better policy choices. We should:

Address market failures through targeted regulations. Recent Brookings analysis documents how the Trump administration implemented “significant rollbacks of major rules affecting air quality” which included “weakened mercury and air toxics standards for coal plants, reduced stringency for new car fuel economy standards, and denied petitions from states requesting regulatory assistance for air pollution that crosses state lines.” The Biden administration recently announced that it is restating some of these rules surrounding air pollution. The administration should continue to reinstate prior rules stripped away by the previous administration, while also identifying other weaknesses in the current regulatory environment.

Invest in green infrastructure. According to the EPA, green infrastructure—including trees, shrubs, and other vegetation—can help improve air quality and reduce urban heat island effects while also helping communities manage stormwater runoff. And a comprehensive literature review finds that green infrastructure can also reduce disparities and address issues including obesity, cardiovascular health, heat-related illness, and psychological health.

Food access and nutrition

Food access and nutritional intake are closely tied to a number of diseases like hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, all of which disproportionately affect Black and Latino or Hispanic individuals in the United States. These diseases have been identified as leading comorbidities of Covid-19, meaning those who have them tend to have worsened Covid-19 outcomes. Many experts cite nutrition as a factor but focus on individual decisionmaking about diet. But a structural account needs to account for the various constraints that households face when making decisions about food. Reducing obesity and diabetes rates is a complex problem that requires long-term solutions but improving access to healthy food and reducing food insecurity among low-income households is a good first step.

Over one in ten families face food insecurity in the United States—and that was before the start of the pandemic, which made things worse. These families are disproportionately Black, Latino, and living below the poverty line. The federal government’s Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), whose recipients are also disproportionately Black and Latino, is meant to address this economic issue. In theory, SNAP is designed to help families near or below the federal poverty line afford a healthy diet. But in practice, SNAP is often insufficient for low-income families to sustain healthy diets because the benefits were based on an outdated model of food consumption and pricing. Thankfully, the model has recently been updated, resulting in a large increase in regular SNAP benefits that began in October 2021.

One policy that has been shown to reduce food insecurity drastically is the expanded child tax credit (CTC). The expanded CTC, which was implemented in March 2021, led to a 25% decline in food insufficiency among low-income families with children. Nevertheless, the expanded CTC received only temporary authorization and has since reverted to its original form, thereby eliminating the monthly payout and lowering the overall amount of support provided to families. Reestablishing the enhanced monthly CTC is of the utmost importance to ensure that we continue to make gains in food security and overall health without losing the progress we’ve already made in the last year.

The United States has lost over 900,000 lives to the Covid-19 virus, and according to analysis by Reuters, the nation ranks worst in per capita deaths among the group of the seven wealthiest countries (G7) in the world. It is clear that we need permanent policy solutions to address the underlying causes of racial disparities in health outcomes. To respond adequately to these disparate outcomes now during the ongoing pandemic, and to prepare for the next health crisis that will inevitably come along, we must improve the built environment, broaden and deepen the social safety net, and ensure that everyone has access to the health resources they need in order to flourish."

The horns are silenced in Ottawa, at least for the time being. The vehicles that blocked downtown streets, and the drivers who leaned on their horns day and night, are gone. The residents who complained, and held up signs saying “I want sleep,” and joined a class-action suit that successfully won an injunction to stop the noise, can rest easy.

Or can they? Now it’s back to the regular old urban din: leaf blowers and jackhammers, drag-racing cars and motorcycles that seem to have roared off the set of a Mad Max movie. The noise of an average city, while preferable to screeching air horns and bursts of fireworks, is still too loud for good health. Noise pollution is an invisible health hazard and easy to overlook, but in fact prolonged exposure to loud noise is associated with higher levels of heart disease and high blood pressure, impaired cognition and poor mental health. Not to mention damaged hearing – just ask Dave Grohl.

Most of us haven’t played drums for very loud rock bands, but if we live in cities we’re often exposed to noise at the pain threshold and are perhaps even resigned to the fact that nothing can be done about it. We accept going to sleep with earplugs and waking up with ground-down molars as the price of urban living. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Some enlightened cities are leading the way to a quieter future.

Science should be a candle in the dark, but it’s being snuffed out

Paris is tackling the problem by installing sensors that record excessive noise and take pictures of the roaring motorcycle or vehicle. Offenders will receive tickets of €100 (about $145), which frankly doesn’t seem like too much of a deterrent, especially when you consider the cost to human health: “Noise reduces the life expectancy of Parisians by nine months,” Paris’s deputy mayor David Belliard told The New York Times.

Those acoustic cameras are also in use in Kensington and Chelsea, one of the poshest neighbourhoods in Britain, in order to crack down on expensive sport cars that plague its streets, a move called “super fines for supercars.”

Toronto also recently pledged a crackdown on excessively noisy cars, although the last time the city tried, the mighty crackdown proved to be more of a sad little whisper. It might be time for Toronto’s leaders to reread the city’s 2017 report How Loud is Too Loud?, which lays out the many deleterious effects of excess noise.

The state of New York has gone straight to the source: the autobody shops that are illegally outfitting cars with souped-up mufflers and exhausts to make them sound supermacho. These modifications are tied to “aggressive driving that harms community health, safety and comfort,” the government of New York noted. A body shop caught turning a car into a noisemaker can be fined US$1,000.

All of these initiatives on their own might prove somewhat useful in turning down the volume, but a much broader and more holistic approach is going to be needed, according to a new United Nations report which lists noise pollution alongside wildfires as a pressing environmental threat. In Europe, around 12,000 premature deaths a year can be attributed to noise pollution, and – as is so often the case – it is poor and marginalized people who are hardest hit.

But the report holds out a lot of hope. For one thing, not all sound is created equal. The human ear is delighted by birdsong and other noises of nature, and even quite loud noises can sometimes be pleasant – Big Ben’s bonging, for example. What the report calls for is a rethinking of the urban landscape to reduce trauma to our ears, by using trees and landscaping as sound buffers, as well as reducing traffic sounds and increasing parks and other green spaces. (Paris has said it’s going to add trees as part of its sound-reduction program.)

Imagine waking up to the sound of wind in the trees, instead of your neighbour’s car alarm going off for the 10th time so that you have to hurl a can of tomatoes in the car’s general direction. (This incident may, or may not, be drawn from real life.) My entire adult life I’ve lived in big cities and mistook the racket for vibrancy: the screaming, brawling drunks in London, the news helicopters overhead in Los Angeles constantly patrolling for miscreants, the pulsing techno that boomed out of every park in Berlin at midnight.

It was actually in Berlin where I learned the power of silence as a communal force for good. Germany has a long-standing tradition of Ruhezeit, “quiet time” or “quiet hours” that mandate when noise has to be kept to a minimum. Germans will tell newcomers about bylaws preventing car-washing or vacuuming on Sundays, sort of like telling terrifying fables to children to keep them in line.

The reality is that you’re not likely to be arrested for mowing your lawn on a Sunday, but you might get a hairy eyeball from your neighbour. I once received a stern lecture from someone in another apartment after I’d put bottles in the communal recycling on a Sunday. It was verboten, even though I’d tried to do it as quietly as possible. I slunk back to my apartment and did not disturb the peace again.

Germans are very good at recognizing the regenerative power of calm and quiet, not just for themselves but for their neighbourhoods and communities. Maybe the message is beginning to spread – quietly but far and wide.

Putin of Russia announced on television that he had decided “to carry out a special military operation” in Ukraine, explosions were reported across the country.

Blasts were heard in Kyiv, the capital; in Kharkiv, the second largest city; and in Kramatorsk in the region of Donetsk, one of two eastern Ukrainian territories claimed by Russia-backed separatists since 2014.

Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian troops had landed in the southern port city of Odessa and were crossing from Russia into Kharkiv. Footage captured by security cameras showed Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine from Crimea, the peninsula that Russia seized in 2014.

Rocket attacks targeted Ukrainian fighter jets parked at an airport outside Kyiv, and Ukraine closed its airspace to commercial flights, citing the “potential hazard to civilian aviation.”

More than 40 Ukrainian soldiers were killed and dozens were wounded in the fighting on Thursday morning, said Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.

As air raid sirens blared in Kyiv, the western city of Lviv and other urban areas, residents rushed to take shelter in bus and subway stations. In Kyiv, people packed up their cars and waited in long lines to fill up with gas on their way out of the city. In eastern Ukraine, early signs of panic appeared on the streets as lines formed at A.T.M.s and gas stations.

With attacks across the country, it quickly became clear that Russia’s campaign, whatever Mr. Putin meant by a “special military operation,” was aimed at far more than the rebel territories in the east. Within an hour, Ukraine’s state emergency service said that attacks had been launched in 10 regions of Ukraine, primarily in the east and south, and that reports of new shelling were “coming in constantly.”

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, called it “a full-scale invasion of Ukraine” and said his country would defend itself, while calling on the world to “stop Putin.”

Russia’s Defense Ministry said that it was using “high-precision weapons” to disable military infrastructure, air defense facilities, military airfields and Ukrainian army planes, Russia’s state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. But the ministry said it was not attacking cities, and promised that “the civilian population is not at risk.”

The Ukrainian authorities said that invading naval forces were coming ashore at multiple points, including in Kharkiv and the southern city of Kherson. Three emergency workers were injured when a command post was struck by shelling in Nizhyn, in the north, and six people were trapped under rubble when the city’s airport came under attack, Ukraine’s Interior Ministry reported.

Military depots, warehouses and National Guard were hit with artillery blasts, the ministry said.

As dawn broke in Kyiv, Mr. Zelensky of Ukraine said he had declared martial law. The country’s defense minister told citizens that the army was “fending off enemy forces” and “doing everything it can to protect you.”

But the army was under siege. In the east, Russia-backed separatists — their ranks bolstered by the arrival of hundreds of Russian mercenaries in recent days, according to European officials — said they were hammering Ukrainian troops along the entire 250-mile front line that has divided the rebels and Ukrainian forces since 2014.

Seeking to capture the entire territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, which Mr. Putin recognized as independent on Monday, the rebels were “using all weapons at their disposal,” the Russian news media reported. Ukrainian officials said the attacks included artillery strikes.

Ukraine’s state border service reported that Russian troops stationed in Belarus, north of Ukraine, had launched an attack with support from the Belarusian military. Russia had deployed as many as 30,000 troops to Belarus for exercises this month that the United States warned could provide cover for an attack against Kyiv, which lies a fast 140-mile drive away from a main border crossing. President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus denied that his forces were involved.

By midmorning in Kyiv, Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had disabled all of Ukraine’s air defenses and air bases. Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian forces had captured two villages in the Luhansk region.

The fighting intensified as Ukrainian forces shot down six Russian fighters and a helicopter in a fight to maintain control over key cities, a senior Ukrainian military official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to release information outside official channels. Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, called on all Ukrainian civilians to join the fight and enlist with territorial defense units.

“Ukraine is moving into all-out defense mode,” he said."

By making everyday items like cars electric, and installing smart systems to monitor and reduce energy use, it seems we’ll still be able to enjoy the comforts to which we’ve become accustomed while doing our bit for the planet – a state known as “green growth”.

But the risks of this approach are becoming ever clearer. Many modern technologies use materials like copper, cobalt, lithium and rare earth elements. These metals are in devices like cell phones, televisions and motors. Not only is their supply finite, but large amounts of energy are required for their extraction and processing – producing significant emissions.

Plus, many of these devices are inherently difficult to recycle. This is because to make them, complex mixes of materials are created, often in very small quantities. It’s very expensive to collect and separate them for recycling.

Among others, these limitations have led some to question the high-tech direction our society is taking – and to develop a burgeoning interest in low-tech solutions. These solutions prioritise simplicity and durability, local manufacture, as well as traditional or ancient techniques.

What’s more, low-tech solutions often focus on conviviality. This involves encouraging social connections, for example through communal music or dance, rather than fostering the hyper-individualism encouraged by resource-hungry digital devices.

“Low-tech” does not mean a return to medieval ways of living. But it does demand more discernment in our choice of technologies – and consideration of their disadvantages.

Origins of low-tech

Critics have proclaimed the downsides of excessive technology for centuries, from 19th century Luddites to 20th century writers like Jacques Ellul and Lewis Mumford. But it was the western energy crisis in the 1970s that really popularised these ideas.

British economist E.F. Schumacher’s 1973 book Small is Beautiful presented a powerful critique of modern technology and its depletion of resources like fossil fuels. Instead, Schumacher advocated for simplicity: locally affordable, efficient technologies (which he termed “intermediate” technologies), like small hydroelectricity devices used by rural communities.

Schumacher’s mantle has been taken up by a growing movement calling itself “low-tech”. Belgian writer Kris de Dekker’s online Low-Tech Magazine has been cataloguing low-tech solutions, such as windmills that use friction to heat buildings, since 2007. In particular, the magazine explores obsolete technologies that could still contribute to a sustainable society: like fruit walls used in the 1600s to create local, warm microclimates for growing Mediterranean fruits.

In the US, architect and academic Julia Watson’s book Lo-TEK (where TEK stands for Traditional Ecological Knowledge) explores traditional technologies from using reeds as building materials to creating wetlands for wastewater treatment.

And in France, engineer Philippe Bihouix’s realisation of technology’s drain on resources led to his prize-winning book The Age of Low Tech. First published in 2014, it describes what life in a low-tech world might be like, including radically cutting consumption.

Bihouix presents seven “commandments” of the low-tech movement. Among others, these cover the need to balance a technology’s performance with its environmental impact, being cautious of automation (especially where employment is replaced by increased energy use), and reducing our demands on nature.

But the first principle of low-tech is its emphasis on sobriety: avoiding excessive or frivolous consumption, and being satisfied by less beautiful models with lower performance. As Bihouix writes:

A reduction in consumption could make it quickly possible to rediscover the many simple, poetic, philosophical joys of a revitalised natural world … while the reduction in stress and working time would make it possible to develop many cultural or leisure activities such as shows, theatre, music, gardening or yoga.

Ancient solutions

Crucially, we can apply low-tech principles to our daily lives now. For example, we can easily reduce energy demand from heating by using warm clothes and blankets. Food, if it’s packaged at all, can be bought and stored in reusable, recyclable packaging like glass.

Architecture offers multiple opportunities for low-tech approaches, especially if we learn from history. Using ancient windcatcher towers designed to allow external cool air to flow through rooms lets buildings be cooled using much less energy than air conditioning. And storing heat in stones, used by the Romans for underfloor heating, is being considered today as a means of dealing with the intermittency of renewable energy.

Design and manufacture for sustainability emphasises reducing waste, often through avoiding mixing and contaminating materials. Simple materials like plain carbon steels, joined using removable fasteners, are easy to recycle and locally repair. Buses, trains and farm machinery using these steels, for example, can be much more readily refurbished or recycled than modern cars full of microelectronics and manufactured from sophisticated alloys.

In some places, the principles of low tech are already influencing urban design and industrial policy. Examples include “15-minute cities” where shops and other amenities are easily accessible to residents, using cargo bikes instead of cars or vans for deliveries, and encouraging repairable products through right-to-repair legislation in the EU and US.

Meanwhile, in Japan, there’s emerging interest in the reuse and recycling practices of the Edo period. From 1603 to 1867, the country was effectively closed to the outside world, with very limited access to raw materials. Therefore, extensive reuse and repair – even of things such as broken pottery or utensils with holes that we’d now regard as waste – became a way of life. Specialist repairers would mend or recycle everything from paper lanterns and books to shoes, pans, umbrellas and candles.

By following examples like these, we can make discerning technological choices a central part of our search for sustainable ways of living."

The city and its metropolitan region have spent decades trying to convince out-of-town professionals and businesses that it would be a great place to move. Now their wish has been granted, and the city is grappling with the consequences.

Growth is never perfect, and Spokane’s influx has been accompanied by a booming employment market that has increased wages, turned abandoned warehouses into offices and helped the city recover jobs lost during the pandemic. This is normally called progress. But for people who already lived in and around Spokane or the suburbs just across the border in north Idaho, the shift from living in a place that was broadly affordable to broadly not has come on with the suddenness of a car crash. Now many workers are wondering what the point of growth is if it only makes it harder to keep a roof over their head.

Even the mayor isn’t immune. In an interview, Nadine Woodward, a Republican who was elected in 2019, noted that her son and daughter-in-law, newlyweds who moved home during the pandemic, were living with her and her husband while they figured out where they could afford to settle. They came back to Spokane from Seattle, where they were long ago priced out. Austin was the next city on their list, but then its home prices shot up to about where Seattle’s were when they left. At this point, even Spokane is seeming pricey.

“I never thought I’d see the day where my adult children couldn’t afford a home in Spokane,” Ms. Woodward said.

Between Seattle and Minneapolis

Standing by a snow-covered lawn on an overcast afternoon, Steve Silbar, a local real estate agent who has been selling homes for five years, explained Spokane’s transformation in terms of a six-inch screen. When he thinks of a typical buyer, Mr. Silbar said, he imagines a couple thousands of miles away, perhaps on a beach, looking at their phones. They’re considering moving to a cheaper city, and do a search for homes.

Clients like this are why Mr. Silbar invested $3,000 in a camera that allows him to create three-dimensional tours of his listings, and why the exterior of every home he sells is showcased with an aerial video shot by a drone. In a market that attracts so many outsiders, a virtual walk through the interior and bird’s-eye flight over the street can be the nudge buyers need to bid on a home they’ve never entered, in a city they’ve never seen."

Blasts were heard in Kyiv, the capital; in Kharkiv, the second largest city; and in Kramatorsk in the region of Donetsk, one of two eastern Ukrainian territories claimed by Russia-backed separatists since 2014.

Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian troops had landed in the southern port city of Odessa and were crossing from Russia into Kharkiv. Footage captured by security cameras showed Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine from Crimea, the peninsula that Russia seized in 2014.

Rocket attacks targeted Ukrainian fighter jets parked at an airport outside Kyiv, and Ukraine closed its airspace to commercial flights, citing the “potential hazard to civilian aviation.”

More than 40 Ukrainian soldiers were killed and dozens were wounded in the fighting on Thursday morning, said Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.

As air raid sirens blared in Kyiv, the western city of Lviv and other urban areas, residents rushed to take shelter in bus and subway stations. In Kyiv, people packed up their cars and waited in long lines to fill up with gas on their way out of the city. In eastern Ukraine, early signs of panic appeared on the streets as lines formed at A.T.M.s and gas stations.

With attacks across the country, it quickly became clear that Russia’s campaign, whatever Mr. Putin meant by a “special military operation,” was aimed at far more than the rebel territories in the east. Within an hour, Ukraine’s state emergency service said that attacks had been launched in 10 regions of Ukraine, primarily in the east and south, and that reports of new shelling were “coming in constantly.”

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, called it “a full-scale invasion of Ukraine” and said his country would defend itself, while calling on the world to “stop Putin.”

Russia’s Defense Ministry said that it was using “high-precision weapons” to disable military infrastructure, air defense facilities, military airfields and Ukrainian army planes, Russia’s state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. But the ministry said it was not attacking cities, and promised that “the civilian population is not at risk.”

The Ukrainian authorities said that invading naval forces were coming ashore at multiple points, including in Kharkiv and the southern city of Kherson. Three emergency workers were injured when a command post was struck by shelling in Nizhyn, in the north, and six people were trapped under rubble when the city’s airport came under attack, Ukraine’s Interior Ministry reported.

Military depots, warehouses and National Guard were hit with artillery blasts, the ministry said.

As dawn broke in Kyiv, Mr. Zelensky of Ukraine said he had declared martial law. The country’s defense minister told citizens that the army was “fending off enemy forces” and “doing everything it can to protect you.”

But the army was under siege. In the east, Russia-backed separatists — their ranks bolstered by the arrival of hundreds of Russian mercenaries in recent days, according to European officials — said they were hammering Ukrainian troops along the entire 250-mile front line that has divided the rebels and Ukrainian forces since 2014.

Seeking to capture the entire territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, which Mr. Putin recognized as independent on Monday, the rebels were “using all weapons at their disposal,” the Russian news media reported. Ukrainian officials said the attacks included artillery strikes.

Ukraine’s state border service reported that Russian troops stationed in Belarus, north of Ukraine, had launched an attack with support from the Belarusian military. Russia had deployed as many as 30,000 troops to Belarus for exercises this month that the United States warned could provide cover for an attack against Kyiv, which lies a fast 140-mile drive away from a main border crossing. President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus denied that his forces were involved.

By midmorning in Kyiv, Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had disabled all of Ukraine’s air defenses and air bases. Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian forces had captured two villages in the Luhansk region.

The fighting intensified as Ukrainian forces shot down six Russian fighters and a helicopter in a fight to maintain control over key cities, a senior Ukrainian military official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to release information outside official channels. Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, called on all Ukrainian civilians to join the fight and enlist with territorial defense units.

“Ukraine is moving into all-out defense mode,” he said."

Whatever the reasons, and there were many, Steve MacDonald decided he was done with Los Angeles. He wanted a city that was smaller and cheaper, big enough that he could find a decent restaurant but not so much that its problems felt unsolvable and every little task like an odyssey. After the pandemic hit and he and his wife went through a grand reprioritizing, they centered on Spokane, where their son went to college. They had always liked visiting and decided it would be a nice place to move.

Eastern Washington was of course much colder. Until this winter, MacDonald, a native Southern Californian, had never shoveled snow. But their new house is twice as big as their Los Angeles home, cost less than half as much and is a five-minute commute from City Hall, where MacDonald works as Spokane’s director of community and economic development.

He arrives each day to tackle a familiar conundrum: how to prevent Spokane from developing the same kinds of problems that people like him are moving there to escape.

“I’m realizing more and more how important the future prosperity of this city is about getting housing right,” he said. “If we don’t, it’s going to track more closely with what happened in Los Angeles.”

MacDonald knows the pattern, and so does everyone else who has been following the U.S. housing market for the past decade. The story plays out locally but is national in scope. It is the story of people leaving high-cost cities because they’ve been priced out or become fed up with how impossible the housing problem seems. Then it becomes the story of a city trying to tame prices by building more housing, followed by the story of neighbors fighting to prevent it, followed by the story of less expensive cities being deluged with buyers from more expensive cities, followed by the less expensive cities descending into the same problems and struggling with the same solutions.

Story continues

It’s easier to change where we live than it is to change how we live.

Whether it’s Boise, Idaho, or Reno, Nevada, or Portland, Oregon, or Austin, Texas, the American housing market is caught in a vicious cycle of broken expectations that operates like a food chain: The sharks flee New York and Los Angeles and gobble up the housing in Austin and Portland, whose priced-out homebuyers swim to the cheaper feeding grounds of places like Spokane. The cycle brings bitterness and “Don’t Move Here” bumper stickers — and in Spokane it has been supercharged during the pandemic and companies’ shift to remote work.

No matter how many times it happens, no matter how many cities and states try to blunt it with recommendations to build more housing and provide subsidies for those who can’t afford the new stuff, no matter how many zoning battles are fought or homeless camps lamented, no next city, as of yet, seems better prepared than the last one was.

Just a few years ago, a Spokane household that made the median income could afford about two-thirds of the homes on the market, according to Zillow. Now home prices are up 60% over the past two years, pricing out broad swaths of the populace and fomenting an escalating housing crisis marked by resentment, zoning fights and tents.

Being an “it” place was something Spokane’s leaders had long hoped for. The city and its metropolitan region have spent decades trying to convince out-of-town professionals and businesses that it would be a great place to move. Now their wish has been granted, and the city is grappling with the consequences.

Growth is never perfect, and Spokane’s influx has been accompanied by a booming employment market that has increased wages, turned abandoned warehouses into offices and helped the city recover jobs lost during the pandemic. This is normally called progress. But for people who already lived in and around Spokane or the suburbs just across the border in north Idaho, the shift from living in a place that was broadly affordable to broadly not has come on with the suddenness of a car crash. Now many workers are wondering what the point of growth is if it only makes it harder to keep a roof over their head.

Even the mayor isn’t immune. In an interview, Nadine Woodward, a Republican who was elected in 2019, noted that her son and daughter-in-law, newlyweds who moved home during the pandemic, were living with her and her husband while they figured out where they could afford to settle. They came back to Spokane from Seattle, where they were long ago priced out. Austin was the next city on their list, but then its home prices shot up to about where Seattle’s were when they left. At this point, even Spokane is seeming pricey.

“I never thought I’d see the day where my adult children couldn’t afford a home in Spokane,” Woodward said.

A Between Place

Standing by a snow-covered lawn on an overcast afternoon, Steve Silbar, a local real estate agent who has been selling homes for five years, explained Spokane’s transformation in terms of a 6-inch screen. When he thinks of a typical buyer, Silbar said, he imagines a couple thousands of miles away, perhaps on a beach, looking at their phones. They’re considering moving to a cheaper city, and do a search for homes.

Clients like this are why Silbar invested $3,000 in a camera that allows him to create three-dimensional tours of his listings, and why the exterior of every home he sells is showcased with an aerial video shot by a drone. In a market that attracts so many outsiders, a virtual walk through the interior and bird’s-eye flight over the street can be the nudge buyers need to bid on a home they’ve never entered, in a city they’ve never seen.

“I have to assume that the person that is looking at my listing has never been to Spokane, does not know about Spokane, has no clue,” Silbar said.

Spokane is the largest city on the road from Seattle to Minneapolis. This fact is frequently cited as the logic behind its economy: It’s between things. The city was incorporated in 1881 and grew into a transportation hub for the surrounding mining and logging industries. It remains a hub, only instead of shipping out timber and silver, businesses revolve around Fairchild Air Force Base and a collection of hospitals and universities that draw from the rural towns that stretch from eastern Washington to northern Idaho and into western Montana.

The transition from past to present plays out across a skyline in which the usual collection of anonymous bank and hotel towers is broken up by historic brick buildings that seem to be either in a state of abandonment or rehabilitation or occupied by low-rent tenants while waiting for redevelopment. The current boom has already made its mark in the form of new apartment towers, warehouses-turned-office buildings and an empty lot that will soon contain a 22-story building that will be the city’s tallest.

Driving around town, Michael Sharapata, a commercial real estate broker who moved to Spokane from the Bay Area in 2017, gave a staccato accounting of new leases, such as the millions of square feet that Amazon occupies out by the airport, or the satellite offices rented by various regional accounting and building firms.

His family is coming, too. After Sharapata and his wife moved north, they were followed, in rapid succession, by his brother-in-law in Austin, another brother-in-law in the Bay Area and his sister-in-law in Salt Lake City.

“We were looking for an affordable community that had an opportunity to accommodate all of us,” he said.

As in most of urban America, much of the growth in the Spokane area is on the fringes, where heavy equipment and the skeletal outlines of new subdivisions unfold in every direction and into Idaho. Building permits have surged, and the cadre of mostly local builders who had the market more or less to themselves now grumble that the rapid growth has attracted big national builders like D.R. Horton and Toll Brothers.

All of this happened fairly recently. In the years after the Great Recession, when homebuilders were in bankruptcy or hibernation, migration to the Spokane area plunged. That pattern shifted in 2014 when, as if a switch had been flipped, waves of migrants started arriving as already high-cost cities like Seattle and San Francisco saw their housing markets go into a tech-fueled frenzy.

By the end of 2014, migration to the Spokane area had jumped to more than 2,000 net new residents, compared with a net loss the year before, according to Equifax and Moody’s Analytics. Annual growth has only continued, rising further with the pandemic to more than 4,500 net new residents.

Sometimes they come for the chance to buy their first home. Other times it’s a bigger house or some land. Joel Sweeney, an academic adviser at Eastern Washington University, wanted the best of both: a single-family house on a quiet street that was close enough to downtown that he could walk to a good brewery. That sort of Goldilocks urbanity could cost $1 million in Austin, where he and his wife lived until last year. When they moved to Spokane they paid less than a third of that.

“You could not get a house for $299,000 in Austin where you could walk to a bunch of different stuff,” he said.

Nurses and Teachers

The white house with the red door sits on a quiet block near Gonzaga University. It has two bedrooms, one bathroom and 1,500 square feet of living space.

Silbar, the real estate agent, has sold it twice in the past three years. The first time, in November 2019, he represented a buyer who offered $168,000 and got it with zero drama. This year it went back on the market, and Silbar listed it for $250,000. Fourteen offers and a bidding war later, it closed at $300,000.

When Silbar got into the business, he said, his clients were “nurses and teachers,” and now they’re corporate managers, engineers and other professionals. “What you can afford in Spokane has completely changed,” he said.

The typical home in the Spokane area is worth $411,000, according to Zillow. That’s still vastly less expensive than markets like the San Francisco Bay Area ($1.4 million), Los Angeles ($878,000), Seattle ($734,000) and Portland ($550,000). But it’s dizzying (and enraging) to long-term residents.

Five years ago, a little over half the homes in the Spokane area sold for less than $200,000, and about 70% of its employed population could afford to buy a home, according to a recent report commissioned by the Spokane Association of Realtors. Now fewer than 5% of homes — a few dozen a month — sell for less than $200,000, and less than 15% of the area’s employed population can afford a home. A recent survey by Redfin, the real estate brokerage, showed that homebuyers moving to Spokane in 2021 had a budget 23% higher than what locals had.

One of Silbar’s clients, Lindsey Simler, a 38-year-old nurse who grew up in Spokane, wants to buy a home in the $300,000 range but keeps losing out because she doesn’t have enough cash to compete. Spokane isn’t so competitive that it’s awash in all-cash offers, as some higher-priced markets are. But prices have shot up so fast that many homes are appraising for less than their sale price, forcing buyers to put up higher down payments to cover the difference.

A dozen failed offers later, Simler has decided to sit out the market for a while because the constant losing is so demoralizing. If prices don’t calm down, she said, she’s thinking about becoming a travel nurse. With the health care workforce so depleted by COVID-19, travel nursing pays much better and, hopefully, will allow her to save more for a down payment.

“I’m not at the point where I want to give up on living in Spokane, because I have family here and it feels like home,” she said. “But travel nursing is going to be my next step if I haven’t been able to land a house.”

‘Positive Activity’

From her seventh-floor office atop the art deco City Hall, Woodward, the mayor, looked out at the Spokane River, where in the warmer months a gondola glides past her window to the Riverfront Park built for the World’s Fair. Spokane hosted the fair in 1974 as a means of revitalizing its blighted downtown, and during the recent interview Woodward pointed out the window at cranes and construction sites that she calls “positive activity.”

Spokane’s job market is among the strongest in the nation, and the virtuous economic cycle — of people coming for housing, causing businesses to come for people, causing more people to come for jobs — is in full swing. And yet, as in Seattle and California before and increasingly across the nation, the scourge of rising prices, particularly for rent and housing, makes it feel less virtuous than advertised.

The recent Realtors report warned of “significant social implications” if the city doesn’t tackle housing. The issues included young families not being able to buy or taking on excessive debt, small businesses not being able to hire, and difficulty keeping young college graduates in town.

In the dominoes of the housing market, the disappointments of aspiring buyers like Simler get magnified as they move down to lower-income households. With homes so hard to buy, rents have shot up, and the vacancy rate for apartments is close to zero.

All of this has compounded at the lowest end of the market, where the nonprofit Volunteers of America’s Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho affiliate, which runs three shelters and maintains 240 apartments for people who were formerly homeless, said it will lose a quarter of its units in the next fiscal year as more of its funding goes to higher rents.

In December, as temperatures dropped and shelters filled, advocates and members of the homeless population protested by setting up several dozen tents on the City Hall steps. The encampment was gone two weeks later but has since been reconstructed on a patch of dirt on the other side of town. In the winter cold it smells like ash and soot from the open fires burning to keep people warm.

Last year, Woodward declared a housing emergency, and her administration has put in place initiatives that mirror those of housing-troubled cities on the West Coast. The city has built new shelters, is encouraging developers to repurpose commercial buildings into apartments, is making it easier for residents to build backyard units, and is rezoning the city to allow duplexes and other multiunit buildings in single-family neighborhoods.

Woodward pointed to Kendall Yards, one of the developments outside her City Hall window, as an example of what she wanted to see more of. The mixed-density project could be a postcard picture of what economists and planners say is needed to combat the nation’s housing shortage and sprawl.

In defiance of the single-family zoning laws that dictate the look of most U.S. neighborhoods, Kendall Yards has houses next to town homes next to apartments, with retail and office mixed in.

People in town seem to love it, but are leery of there being more places like it, especially in their neighborhood.

“I think it’s awesome — I have friends there, and we go down there to the farmers market and walk around,” said John Schram, a co-chair of the neighborhood council in Spokane’s Comstock neighborhood. “That’s just not my vision of what I want for me. My concern is that I move into a neighborhood because of the way that it was designed when I got there, and when somebody else comes in and wants to change that I’m going to be concerned.”

He added: “I have nothing against duplexes and triplexes, just not next to my house.”

Americans across the country have used legal guns to defend themselves and thwart crimes, but the reports often fly under the radar and most people are unaware how often guns are used in self-defense cases.

""Having a gun is by far the safest course of action when people are facing a criminal by themselves,"" Dr. John Lott, an economist and president of the Crime Prevention Research Center , told Fox News Digital. He pointed to women in particular, who ""behave passively"" and are ""about 2.4 times more likely to end up being seriously injured than a woman who has a gun to protect herself.""

As crimes skyrocketed in major cities since 2020, instances of women using guns to protect themselves and stop crimes have repeatedly played out.

HERE ARE 10 TIMES LEGAL GUN OWNERS RECENTLY THWARTED CRIMES IN LIFE-THREATENING SITUATIONS

""Thank God I had my gun, or I’d probably be dead right now,"" a Chicago woman with a concealed carry permit said in October after two would-be carjackers approached her outside a bank.

""Thank God I had my gun, or I’d probably be dead right now."" — Chicago crime victim

In New Orleans just last week, a mom and Air Force veteran pulled a gun on a man who tried to get into her car while she was sitting in gridlocked traffic with her 2-year-old son . She wasn’t forced to fire the weapon and the suspect took off.

‘Dramatic undercount’

Lott said that, in a typical year, the media reports about 2,000 defensive gun use stories, but he added ""that is a dramatic undercount, because the vast majority of successful self-defense cases don’t make the news.""

STUDY SHOWS CONCEALED HANDGUN PERMITS SOARED DURING PANDEMIC, RECORD YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE

Lott said there are about 2 million defensive gun uses per year, according to the average of 18 national surveys.

The Heritage Foundation, which launched a database tracking how often guns are used in self-defense cases, cites the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which looked at various studies and found ""that Americans use their firearms defensively between 500,000 and 3 million times each year.""

""The reality is, I think this number shocks a lot of people,"" Amy Swearer, a legal fellow in the Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital in a phone interview.

Swearer noted that even ""two outlier studies"" that found fewer instances of guns being used in self-defense, they still reported guns being used ""tens of thousands times every year.""

Lott said that people using guns in self-defense overwhelmingly don’t even lead to a criminal being killed or wounded.

12 MAJOR DEM CONTROLLED CITIES BREAK HOMICIDE RECORDS FOLLOWING HISTORICALLY BLOODY 2020

""Ninety-five percent of defensive gun uses involve merely brandishing a gun, and less than 1% involve the attacker being killed or wounded. But most news stories only report on cases where attackers are killed and brandishings are ignored. It is understandable that someone getting killed is more newsworthy than a woman brandishing a gun and the criminal running away without committing a crime, but from a policy perspective we care about both cases,"" he said.

""Most news stories only report on cases where attackers are killed and brandishings are ignored."" — Dr. John Lott, Crime Prevention Research Center

Homicide rates broke records in at least 16 major cities last year, while parts of California were plagued by smash-and-grab robberies, and cities such as Philadelphia and Chicago saw staggering spikes in carjackings.

AT LEAST 16 CITIES SEE RECORD HOMICIDES IN 2021

With the spike in crimes came fears from city residents that they needed to protect themselves.

In Beverly Hills, California, for example, a gun store owner told Fox News Digital earlier this year that sales recently spiked for him as residents look for a last-ditch effort for protection even though the city has a long record of supporting liberal policies and gun control.

Concealed permit surge

It’s a trend that has washed across the nation since 2020. The number of concealed handgun permits surged to 21.52 million in 2020, a 48% increase since 2016 and a 10.5% increase from the same time last year, according to a study conducted by the Crime Prevention Research Center released in October.

Lott said that last year, ""women made up 28.3% of permit holders in the 14 states that provide data by gender."" While permitted concealed carry among Black Americans grew 135.7% faster than their White counterparts.

""The people who benefit the most from owning guns are also the ones who are the most likely victims of violent crime — poor Blacks who live in high crime urban areas,"" according to Lott.

""The people who benefit the most from owning guns are also the ones who are the most likely victims of violent crime — poor Blacks who live in high crime urban areas."" — Dr. John Lott, Crime Prevention Research Center

Political activist Maj Toure has made similar comments, saying in 2020 that he believes ""more Black people would be alive if they were armed.""

""So when I hear 'unarmed Black man,' I'm sad,"" he told Business Insider Weekly, ""because there should be no such thing.""

BLACK LA RESIDENTS LACK ACCESS TO GUNS AS WEALTHY RUSH TO BUY FIREARMS AMID CRIME WAVE: ACTIVISTS

But activists, researchers and Democratic leaders argue that with more guns comes more crime.

Researchers from Boston University examined all 50 states between 1981 and 2010 and found a ""robust correlation"" between gun ownership and gun homicides.

""This research is the strongest to date to document that states with higher levels of gun ownership have disproportionately large numbers of deaths from firearm-related homicides,"" Boston University professor of community health sciences Michael Siegel said of the research back in 2013.

Meanwhile, gun control groups such as the Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence argue that ""permissive concealed carry permitting laws are linked to 8.6% higher firearm homicide rate, and 13-15% higher violent crime rates compared to 'May Issue' states .""

‘Enough is enough’

President Biden met with New York City Mayor Eric Adams earlier this month and rolled out a plan to stop the flow of guns in the city, bolster law enforcement and increase funding for community policing. A part of the plan also included the Justice Department issuing directives to every U.S. attorney’s office nationwide to ""increase resources dedicated to district-specific violent crime strategies.""

BIDEN, AHEAD OF NYC VISIT, ROLLS OUT STRATEGY TO STOP FLOW OF GUNS, BOLSTER LAW ENFORCEMENT

""Every day in this country, 316 people are shot, 106 are killed. And six NYPD officers have been victims of gun violence so far, just this year — the same in the town north of me, Philadelphia; and my much smaller town of Wilmington, Delaware; and Washington, D.C.,"" Biden said in New York on Feb. 3 .

""It’s enough. Enough is enough,"" he continued.

To Lott, what most people miss amid the emphasis on gun crimes is that ""over 92% of violent crime has nothing to do with guns.""

""The data shows that while violent crime reported to police rose 5% between 2019 and 2020, you can’t blame that increase on guns because gun crimes actually fell by 27%,"" he said.

""The bottom line is that if you want to reduce gun crime, you do the same things that you do to reduce violent crime generally, and that is make it riskier for criminals to commit crime.""

What has changed in the past decade? What hasn't?

Trayvon was shot Feb. 26, 2012, by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who claimed he felt threatened by the Black teenager. Zimmerman followed the 17-year-old in his car, then on foot. Zimmerman was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter when he was tried a year later.

From boogying with Al Gore to sitting down with George and Laura Bush in the bedroom of Air Force One to the ""hell"" of keeping up with Donald Trump

In the 25 years that April Ryan has been covering the White House — now the longest-serving Black woman in the press corps — she has had plenty of encounters with whomever was in the West Wing at the time.

Some were good and some were bad, some were friendly, some were incidental and some were headline-making.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

In September, for example, Ryan ran into President Joe Biden and after a jovial chat he promised her an interview. (She's still waiting.) Years before that, she taught Vice President Al Gore the ""booty call"" dance aboard Air Force Two (""He was not like the stuffy person who we see on camera,"" she remembers).

She has privately huddled aboard Air Force One with President George W. Bush to view Hurricane Katrina's devastation and she was with Barack Obama during a trip to Africa.

Some of her most famous — or infamous — presidential experiences, however, were with Donald Trump, as when he ordered her to ""sit down"" after she asked a question at a press conference and later called her ""nasty"" and a ""loser."" Ryan, no shrinking violet, has likewise sparred with Trump aides over their behavior and denounced Trump himself for some of his incendiary comments.

This has been Ryan's professional life since the '90s, while she has worked as both a White House correspondent and Washington, D.C., bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks and then TheGrio, which she joined last year. She is also an analyst for CNN.

""Five presidents call me by my first name,"" she tells PEOPLE in an interview marking her career milestone.

""Her impact is just enormous,"" says Jerry Lopes, the retired president of program operations of American Urban Radio Network, who hired Ryan in 1997.

A public show of support for Ryan upon her 25th anniversary in January highlighted this legacy, with Presidents Biden, Bill Clinton and Obama sending letters and tweets of congratulations.

""I was shocked,"" the 54-year-old says now of the praise. ""It is so humbling.""

Ryan was born and raised in Baltimore, where both of her working-class parents were ""news junkies.""

""They would listen to the news in the morning, afternoon, in the car, in the evening,"" she says. ""When everybody was home, my father would watch Walter Cronkite. That was embedded in me.""

She studied broadcast journalism at Morgan State University and was a radio DJ before moving to news. ""I had a yearning to find out what was going on,"" she says. ""I got a rush.""

Ryan began her career as a radio reporter in Baltimore and Tennessee, which led to joining American Urban Radio Networks as its White House correspondent and D.C. bureau chief, with a focus on reporting for a primarily Black audience.

""Think about this,"" says Lopes, who was then her boss. ""She's the eyes and ears of Black America.""

No matter which party has been in power in the presidency, Ryan says, ""I ask questions that impact an under-served community, and impact the world … I don't just ask about Black folks. I ask about everything.""

Ryan has used her position to raise the issues of Black farmers during the Clinton administration and the plight of hard-hit black residents of New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina — and secured an interview with then-President Bush and First Lady Laura Bush on Air Force One en route to the hurricane's wreckage.

""President Bush says, 'Well, come back to the bedroom here. It's the quietest place on the airplane,' "" recalls Lopes. ""And so she's got Laura Bush on one side and the president on the other side, and she's sitting in the middle interviewing him, in the bedroom, on the Air Force One.""

There were more lighthearted moments, too. In 1999, aboard Air Force Two on the way back from a trip to Africa, Vice President Gore made his way to the press area. Ryan had earlier seen him dancing and wasn't impressed.

""I said, 'You need to stop doing the Macarena,' "" Ryan remembers now — and she proceeded to teach him the then-popular ""booty call"" line dance as several high-level Clinton officials looked on with humorous disbelief.

""Every time he jumped, the plane moved,"" she says, laughing. ""I was like, 'Oh my God.' It was crazy.""

The Trump presidency shone a whole new spotlight on Ryan — for good and bad.

During a 2017 press conference, Trump asked Ryan if she could arrange a meeting for him with members of the Congressional Black Caucus. ""It was just jaw-dropping,"" says Lopes. ""She's like, 'Me set up?' You're the president of the United States. You could meet with anybody.""

Another time Ryan asked Trump spokesman Sean Spicer questions about the administration's links to Russia. His replies — including the admonishment to Ryan to ""stop shaking your head"" — led to a rebuke from Hillary Clinton and the trending Twitter hashtag #BlackWomenatWork.

Undaunted, she continued over ensuing months to ask the administration questions, including if Trump had considered leaving office, and ended up receiving death threats.

""It was tough not knowing what the hell was going to come out of his mouth any day,"" she says, ""because the hell that comes out of his mouth created hell all over the place.""

But she kept working.

""I was told by a very high-ranking Black Republican that they said they didn't know I was as formidable as I was,"" she says.

Out of safety concerns Ryan did move her family from their home. She says her oldest daughter, now a student at American University, developed post-traumatic stress disorder from the experience, a catalyst for the daughter's desire to become a psychologist.

When asked how all this has affected her, Ryan says: ""I grew up with people who prayed for me, but I also grew up having to be strong.""

Things are better now with the new administration, whose officials have made it a point — with some exceptions — to foster a more traditional rapport with the press.

""It's a friendly, adversarial relationship,"" Ryan says. ""I am not here supporting a Democrat or a Republican. I'm here to ask the questions.""

""I did run into Joe Biden in September, I was shocked he couldn't recognize me,"" she says. ""He said, 'Pull your mask off,' and I said, 'I'm not pulling my mask off for you.' So he popped his off and I popped mine off, too. He said, 'Oh, yeah.' We talked for a while. And we had a good conversation.""

There have been some professional snafus: In 2019, another reporter accused one of Ryan's bodyguards of assaulting him while he was covering a keynote she gave. She said then that she had hired security because of ongoing threats but ""I did not order anyone to do anything at that moment."" Ryan said the guard may have ""overreacted.""

Over the years, Ryan has built a web of connections that give her scoops and high-level insights. ""Washington is nothing but relationships,"" she says. ""The biggest challenge has been breaking the ceiling for specialty media because I work for Black organizations. But when I put it out there, people go crazy over it. And they trust me.""

Still, Ryan says, there is ""that segment that just wants to look down on you because you're Black media. I don't carry it like Black media. I carry it like everybody media.""

Ryan's life is more than just her job. She spends time caring for her kids and relaxing with old movies and reality shows including The Real Housewives of Atlanta and 90 Day Fiancé.

""I need mindless entertainment after being so engrossed in this crazy world of politics daily,"" she says.

And she gushes over the loving relationship she is in with a retired Naval officer, James. (The couple would prefer not to reveal his full name, to preserve his privacy). Ryan says they plan to marry in the next several years.

After they met in passing at a Baltimore airport, James pursued her for two years until she finally agreed to a date.

""He is a sweet man and he's gentle, he's kind, he's giving, he's very loving,"" Ryan says. ""I was telling him, 'No, no, no, no.' I stopped one day and it was like he grabbed me and I was like, 'Oh my God,' and I've not regretted it.""

James is smitten. ""When we first went out for dinner, the entire time we were laughing and talking,"" says the 51-year-old dad of a daughter. ""It was like somebody that you've known for a long time. I love being with her.""

With marriage (and launching a homemade candle business) in the future, so too is Ryan's continued commitment to her work reporting on the White House."

London, Manchester and Birmingham occupied the three bottom spots in a ranking of 36 metropoles by affordability.

Researchers looked at each city and compared the price of a monthly travel pass to the average household budget.

London ranked bottom with its £167 zone 1-3 price cap taking up 9.6 per cent of average household budget.

By contrast an equivalent pass in Copenhagen, the most proportionally affordable city, takes up just 1.3 per cent of a local resident’s household budget. A 30-day commuter pass costs 620 Danish Krone (£69), while residents enjoy some of the highest incomes in Europe.

Manchester and Birmingham fared little better than London, with Manchester’s monthly System One travel card weighing in at £126 and Birmingham’s TfWM zone 1-3 card costing £105. These account for 9 per cent and 7.9 per cent of household budgets respectively.

The UK government subsidises urban public transport far less than most European countries, with the cost of bus and rail increasing in recent decades, while the cost of motoring has fallen.

In the capital, the government has scrapped regular day-to-day subsidies for Transport for London and requires the operator to cover its costs.

Rail fares are set to increase a further 3.8 per cent next week, while London tube and bus fares will go up by 4.8 per cent. Meanwhile the government has frozen fuel duty since 2009, forgoing around £46bn in revenues.

In Paris, just 2.3 per cent of household income is required for an equivalent public transport ticket. A monthly pass giving free travel on all public transport in the wider Paris region costs just €75 (£62).

Brussels, meanwhile, demands 2.4 per cent, where a regional public transport pass costs €55 (£45). Rome’s ticket costs 2.5 per cent of household income, while Amsterdam’s is 3.6 per cent and Berlin’s is 3.9 per cent.

But London fared well in another metric: access to public transport. Inner London has 10.7 stations and stops per square km, behind only Paris and Lisbon. Manchester and Birmingham respectively ranked 17 and 10 out of the 36 cities studied by this metric, roughly in the middle of the pack.

Oliver Lord, UK head of Clean Cities Campaign, which produced the report, said: “The only way to address our air pollution and climate crisis is to ensure public transport is a cheap, reliable and accessible alternative to the car.

“Our new report shows that UK cities have the least affordable public transport in Europe, which will inevitably get worse given this government’s decision to increase fares in a cost of living crisis.

“This government should be helping, not hindering, our cities to play their role in meeting the UK’s clean air and climate goals.”

Paul Tuohy, chief executive of Campaign for Better Transport, said: “This report makes clear the link between the cost of public transport and efforts to decarbonise transport, and must therefore act as a wake-up call for the UK government.

“We currently have a situation where it is often cheaper to drive or fly short distances than take the train or the bus, whereas the greenest option should always be the cheapest.

“We need more affordable public transport to help us achieve the government’s vision, where public transport, cycling and walking are the first choice when it comes to transport.”

A Department for Transport Spokesperson said: “Public transport in the UK is some of the best in the world and we will continue to build on the strong, green credentials thanks to our Transport Decarbonisation Plan, working towards a cheaper, cleaner and more accessible transport network.”"

However, it is the potential for a bridge that will tower over the historic Black community near Sistrunk Boulevard just northwest of downtown that officials and residents worry would irreversibly harm an area that officials have been aiming to redevelop.

Sistrunk is Fort Lauderdale’s oldest Black community.

Historically, minority neighborhoods across the country have been damaged by hundreds of highways built through them during the middle of the 20th century.

In New Orleans, for example, an expressway cut through historically Black neighborhoods of Treme and the 7th Ward in 1968, decimating a once-bustling thoroughfare of Black-owned businesses. President Joe Biden has said removing such structures could address long-standing inequities in infrastructure.

Fort Lauderdale officials say they’re trying to keep the past from repeating itself.

Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis said developers have already threatened to cancel some building projects. He also noted future residents and business owners don’t want to live or work under a bridge or be subjected to constant train rumblings.

“If you build a bridge, you are furthering that separation between communities and we don’t want that,” he said. “We are trying to tear away those divisions and artificial barriers that have kept us apart for so many decades.”

More than 100 years ago, a small group of Black people from the Bahamas relocated to South Florida to work in the farms in Broward County, making a home in the area, said Paul George, resident historian at the HistoryMiami Museum.

Story continues

“Originally, it was informally just called Colored Town,” he said.

Over time, the community took on the name Sistrunk, in honor of the pioneering physician Dr. James Franklin Sistrunk, founder of the county’s first Black hospital.

Residents included railroad workers who settled in shanties along the tracks before the turn of the 20th century, according to the Fort Lauderdale Community Redevelopment Agency.

Over time, however, the area has suffered from economic neglect, including broken sewage lines, and a lack of investment, he said.

That has started to change lately.

The community is now a city hub for culture, art and life events and has even morphed into a destination for festivals, parades, seminars and workshops, city officials said.

Business owners said they have taken notice of the investments and funding being poured into the area, which they say is showing signs of a better life.

City officials said it’s all part of a Fort Lauderdale redevelopment plan to improve different areas, including Sistrunk.

However, the bridge proposal could stifle urban renewal plans, the mayor said.

“You’re going to crush this redevelopment; something that’s been planned for years,” Trantalis said. “No developer wants to have a train bridge next to their building. It would crush the life out of these developments.”

The Transportation Department's proposed $452 million project — the most expensive and the tallest of the three bridge proposals — would add new trains and stops to the Florida East Coast Railway, used by the commuter rail system Brightline and freight trains, according to a state transportation feasibility study.

Asked how the proposed projects would affect Sistrunk, Phil Schwab, an FDOT consultant overseeing the proposed projects, said: “I’m not sure. We’re getting feedback from the community.”

The department’s other two bridge proposals are building a $240 million, 25-foot-tall bridge and a $444 million, 60-foot-tall bridge. The latter also threatens to harm the historic Black community, city officials said.

Image: The train track on SW 15th Street in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Feb. 18, 2022. (Saul Martinez for NBC News)

The bridge proposals are part of a much larger plan to provide commuter rail service along 27 miles of railway from Aventura in Miami-Dade County to Deerfield Beach in Broward County, home to Fort Lauderdale.

A portion of that stretch must cross the New River in Fort Lauderdale, where city leaders voted unanimously in January in favor of a tunnel under the river, instead. At $1.2 billion, a tunnel is at least double the cost of the 80-foot bridge.

“Sometimes the construction costs are outweighed by the social costs. So even if it does cost a little bit more, think of the positive impact it would have on a community that has long since been artificially divided,” Trantalis said, adding the other options would add 40 trains and stops along its route.

The Broward County Commission, which has the final say on the project, is expected to vote on the so-called local preferred option by the spring, with additional public hearings scheduled in the fall, according to a timeline on the state Transportation Department’s website. The commission declined multiple requests for comment.

Residents who live in the Sistrunk Boulevard community are still trying to determine what the proposals mean for them.

“The information regarding this project needs to be clarified and actual community consultation needs to occur,” Home Beautiful Park Civic Association President Tara Chadwick said, adding they want to hear more information before taking a stand on the issue. The association represents the Sistrunk Boulevard community.

“We have so very many variables to consider with this project including and certainly not limited to the environmental and social considerations,” she said, adding the area is filled with artifacts and evidence of historic and ancestral populations.

Chadwick said residents were asked last year for a letter supporting a publicly funded vodka distillery to be built on a block with seniors and low-income families. But when the letter opposed the distillery, their voices were ignored and they were never notified about an ensuing vote.

The Sistrunk business community says it is opposed to the idea of a bridge and fears construction could bring financial harm.

Ibrahim Khair, owner of Ray’s Market and an apartment complex in the Sistrunk neighborhood, said he’s opposed to the bridge construction fearing it could cause him to sell his properties for lesser value down the road if nearby redevelopment efforts stall.

“I’ve been preparing for retirement for the last 30 years,” he said. “I don’t want anything that’ll hurt my business.”

Mike Husein, owner of Lucy Meat Market in the heart of Sistrunk, feels the same. He prefers construction of an underground tunnel with a train stop near his business, allowing shoppers without cars to patronize his store.

“We’re against the bridge. It is an eyesore. It’s unattractive,” he said."

Two days later, a follow-up article led with the headline “5 of 6 recent pedestrian deaths outside of crosswalks.”

This is the wrong way to talk about traffic violence.

Whether a pedestrian was in or out of a crosswalk obscures the fact that the design of our auto-centric cities kills pedestrians, bicyclists and drivers — all of us. It distracts us from what we really need to do to create healthy communities that, by design, keep us safe — to build people-centered neighborhoods with affordable housing, jobs, services, parks, all within walking and biking distance.

40,000 people nationwide die on our streets every year. In San Jose, 70% of fatal crashes occur during dark hours, 30% are due to speed, and 67% are male drivers. Here’s more bad news:

• 10 crashes take place in San Jose every day — that’s over 300 a month in one city alone. Twenty of those monthly crashes end in death or severe injury.

• For people 25 and under, dying in a car crash is the leading cause of death nationwide.

• 25% of pedestrian deaths nationwide happen inside of crosswalks. The rate of pedestrian deaths in Black communities is twice that of white communities in part because Black and brown neighborhoods are less likely to have crosswalks or other traffic-calming measures due to years of neglect and disinvestment.

And our auto-centered culture causes harm in more ways than one:

• Transportation is the leading cause of air pollution in the U.S.

• Cars contribute to our sedentary lifestyle and the diseases that result from inactivity.

• And as someone who grew up dependent on transit and bikes, I know firsthand that the expense of a car and lack of adequate transportation alternatives is a barrier to upward mobility. The necessity of car ownership keeps people down, economically.

What do we do?

It is unrealistic to think we can fund the number of police officers needed to catch and prevent poor driving, nor is it desirable given the impacts of policing on Black and brown communities.

If we want to create a healthier community, we have to recognize that our physical environment determines and predicts behavior. If you design a couch with three seat cushions, three people feel invited to sit on it. If streets are designed so that corners are sharp, lanes are narrow and lighting is good, people drive slowly and more safely. And if neighborhoods are redesigned so that groceries, libraries, jobs and affordable housing are within biking and walking distance, people are encouraged to get outside on foot, build bonds with each other and care for neighbors, reducing our dependence on cars.

It is unacceptable, cruel and irrational to blame those who can’t afford, aren’t physically able or choose not to drive a car. If we want healthy communities, build people-centered neighborhoods where the needs of each of us is within reach.

Next time your city council is debating urban villages, affordable housing, less parking, narrower streets and an environment that facilitates human interaction, say yes.

Key Takeaways from Market Study

eVTOL aircraft are gaining prominence as urban mobility is taking shape. In China, currently, such aircraft are being used for cargo transportation, majorly aiming to improve aerial logistics. The market in China is expected to expand at close to 30% CAGR through 2031.

The role played by the FAA-Federal Aviation Administration in laying industry standards such as aircraft airworthiness, flight testing, and certification, for eVTOL aircraft, is pivotal. The U.S. is positioned as the top nation in the global market, with the highest market value share. Demand in the U.S. will increase at over 22% CAGR over the next ten years.

Compared to helicopters and other transport media, eVTOLs provide comparatively better features. They emit least noise, are emissions-free, and have a distributed energy propulsion, enabling improved propulsive efficiency. eVTOLs having maximum takeoff weight below 250 kg are expected to create ample opportunities over the forecast period.

Multirotor & rotorcraft eVTOLs will generate credible growth opportunities in future. These aircraft are suitable for commuting in cities where they can travel between shorter distances.

With rising number of autonomous mobility, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) or pilotless aircraft are expected to dominate the global market share, based on operation.

“The number of civil and commercial end uses of eVTOL aircraft will surge as these gradually replace land transportation over the next few years. Rising aircraft developments and surging investments in the aircraft sector are favoring market growth for eVTOL aircraft,” says a Persistence Market Research analyst.

Introduction of Air-taxi Services in Advanced & Emerging Countries

Rise of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) aircraft has changed the paradigm of travel from conventional transport such as cars, buses, and taxis to aerial travel services such as eVTOL. These aircraft are designed to carry up to 10 passengers, commute shorter routes within an urban landscape, provide quick turnarounds for arrivals and departures, and preferably operate autonomously.

This has led to an upsurge in the development of eVTOLs for air-taxi services. Moreover, air-taxis are designed to meet future demand for regional commutes ranging from 30 miles to 300 miles. With growing congestion in urban spaces, the problem of land travel will likely increase. With the use of eVTOLs in the form of air-taxi services, aerial travel will be an affordable transport dimension over shorter places. Use of EVTOLs for air-taxi services is expected to rise by 2023 in select regions, and by 2030 on a global scale.

By Paul Homewood

This story has been doing the rounds in the last few days:

BERLIN/LISBON (Reuters) -A ship carrying around 4,000 vehicles, including Porsches, Audis and Bentleys, that caught fire near the coast of the Azores will be towed to another European country or the Bahamas, the captain of the nearest port told Reuters on Friday.

Lithium-ion batteries in the electric cars on board the vehicle carrier Felicity Ace have caught fire and the blaze requires specialist equipment to extinguish, captain Joao Mendes Cabecas of the port of Hortas said.

It was not clear whether the batteries first sparked the fire.

“The ship is burning from one end to the other… everything is on fire about five metres above the water line,"" Cabecas said.

Pictures provided by the Portuguese maritime authority showed severe burns on the bow and along the 200-metre-long 200 meters (220-yard-long) side of the ship, which according to Refinitiv data was built in 2005 and can carry 17,738 tonnes of weight.

Around 1,100 Porsches and 189 Bentleys were on board, spokespeople for the car brands owned by Volkswagen said. Audi, another Volkswagen brand, confirmed some of its vehicles were also on the ship but did not state how many.

https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/container-ship-carrying-volkswagen-vehicles-075147126.html

Whatever the cause, once the fire spread to the batteries, there was little anybody could do to stop it.

And as the Independent reports:

Specialists will be needed to put out a raging fire on an abandoned cargo ship in the Atlantic Ocean due to complications from burning lithium-ion batteries inside the thousands of luxury cars aboard the vessel.

Experts are now going to be called out to help stop the blaze, as burning lithium-ion batteries can be difficult to stop. Lithium-ion battery fires often require dry chemicals or total flooding of the battery with water to stop.

According to a study done in 2013 by the German Federal Ministry of Transport, Building, and Urban Development, the batteries burn extremely hot and produce noxious gases.

“In the event of a lithium ion battery catching fire, it is important to note that such a fire reaches very high temperatures, produces toxic gases and is inextinguishable,” the report concluded.

Fires caused by the batteries – or which they are caught up in – have become a major concern for international shipping entities, particularly as electric vehicles become more affordable and popular among consumers.

The US Transportation Research Board funded a 2022 study noting the risks and a lack of current readiness to deal with potential fires.

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cargo-ship-fire-electric-batteries-b2018606.html?src=rss

Curiously however, the BBC report on the fire fails to mention the words “battery” or “electric cars” at all!

I wonder why?

Thousands of Porsche and Volkswagen cars have been abandoned on a cargo ship after it caught fire in the Atlantic Ocean en route to the US.

The ship, named Felicity Ace, was travelling from Emden in Germany before it caught ablaze off the coast of Portugal’s Azores islands.

German newspaper Handelsblatt reported the vessel was carrying 3,965 vehicles, which also included Audis, Lamborghinis and a small number of Bentleys.

The ship’s crew have been rescued.

Portugal’s navy said no one was hurt by the fire, which broke out on Wednesday, and the 22 crew members were taken to a hotel after the navy, four merchant ships sailing in the area and the Portuguese Air Force completed the evacuation.

""The owner of the ship Felicity Ace is in contact with the logistic agent in order to draw up a plan for the towing of the ship,"" the navy said in a statement.

""So far, no source of pollution has been recorded.""

According to Handelsblatt, an internal email from Volkswagen USA stated that the ship was carrying 3,965 vehicles of the VW, Porsche, Audi and Lamborghini brands.

Volkswagen did not confirm the number of cars on board, but Porsche said it had about 1,100 of its models on the ship.

The company said it was ""aware of an incident involving a third-party cargo ship transporting Volkswagen Group vehicles across the Atlantic"".

Bentley confirmed that 189 of its cars were also onboard the ship.

""We are working with the shipping company to find out further information,"" said a spokesman.

The ship was travelling to a Volkswagen factory in Davisville, Rhode Island, according to the website Marine Traffic.

One customer tweeted to say his Porsche was on board the abandoned ship.

Arkansas entrepreneurs are making a bold claim to be a global giant in next generation transportation, including flying cars, driverless vehicles, and drones. This claim follows Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson’s recent announcement to create the Arkansas Council on Future Mobility, an advisory board committed to attracting businesses, startups, innovators, and creators.

“This year the nation celebrates the 60th anniversary of John F. Kennedy’s audacious declaration that America would land a man on the moon by the end of the decade, and we succeeded. Our goal is based on that same spirit of innovation, tenacity, and entrepreneurship that existed in 1962—we just happen to believe that it’s Arkansas’ turn to lead on that kind of effort,” said Cyrus Sigari, chairman of the Arkansas Council on Future Mobility and UP.Partners Managing Partner. “The state is in an ideal geographic location. It’s the headquarters to powerhouse companies in supply chain, logistics and retail insights. And the support from the state government to incentivize businesses and pioneers in this space makes this claim more than achievable.”

Last fall, Governor Hutchinson forged key global partnerships that will help position Arkansas as a hub for these technologies across a variety of sectors, such as defense.

“Arkansas has been a leader in transportation and mobility for decades. Today we’re continuing to build on that legacy with the Arkansas Council on Future Mobility,” said Gov. Hutchinson. “I recently traveled to Israel to speak of the work we’ve done in Arkansas with legislation passed in 2019 to allow the piloting of autonomous vehicles and the success we’ve seen thus far. Our storied history with the defense sector will also continue to grow in this new and emerging field of technology. The Natural State has the opportunity to become a hub for the future of mobility, and Arkansans are ready to take this challenge head on.”

One rapidly evolving transportation modality is Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), which uses revolutionary aircraft to move cargo and people more quickly, safely, and sustainably. The future of AAM will address current supply chain and labor shortage challenges seen across the nation. The trillion-dollar future AAM market will greatly increase the availability of jobs in STEM with over 4,000 new jobs in the state by 2045 and is estimated to create $3.6 billion in new economic activity and related stimulus. Agriculture, healthcare, defense, consumer goods and other sectors will be the beneficiaries of this initiative.

According to a privately commissioned NEXA Capital Partners report soon to be released, the inclusion of a world-class original equipment manufacturer (OEM) center for development and manufacturing would add some 7,000 full-time jobs to Arkansas’ base case and create up to $9.9 billion in additional economic activity. This addition would grow Arkansas’ existing aerospace sector by as much as 25%.

“The commercial and defense industry impacts of AAM cannot be ignored and the market is pushing for thoughtful and rapid deployment,” said Chad Causey, Executive Director, Arkansas Aerospace & Defense Alliance (AADA). “With a highly skilled aerospace and defense workforce and a burgeoning entrepreneurial spirit, Arkansas can and will capitalize on this future growth. AAM is a natural fit for the Natural State. Arkansas’ aerospace and defense industries appreciates Governor Hutchinson’s leadership on this issue.”

The industry is already taking hold with Arkansas’ leading companies. Last year, Walmart took to the skies when the retailer announced it would operationalize drone delivery in four stores in Northwest Arkansas in collaboration with Zipline and DroneUp. Today, the retailer has successfully completed hundreds of drone deliveries to select customers in Northwest Arkansas and plans to expand operations in the future.

Another example of transportation progress in Arkansas is autonomous trucking. Walmart and autonomous vehicle company, Gatik, pioneered the use of autonomous refrigerated box trucks in retail operations. Together, the companies have driven more than 200,000 autonomous miles in the state and achieved a worldwide first last year when they removed the safety operator from the driver’s seat.

Electric vehicle technology company Canoo recently announced that it has selected Arkansas as the location for its headquarters, R&D center, and production facility. Canoo will be manufacturing small package delivery vehicles and is expecting to bring 545 high paying jobs to Benton and Washington counties.

“We’re excited to experience the benefits of next generation transportation including its convenience, cost-savings and sustainable impact on communities. Our collaboration with both private and public sectors has not only helped us pioneer the use of autonomous vehicles and drones in the state of Arkansas, but in the retail industry as a whole, and it’s only just the beginning,” said John Furner, President and CEO, Walmart U.S.

J.B. Hunt Transport, one of the largest transportation and logistics companies in North America, has long been interested in the role that emerging transportation technologies will play in the future of the industry.

“We’re proud to be among the many people and organizations who envision a future where Arkansas leads the way in testing and implementing next-generation transportation technology,” said Craig Harper, chief sustainability officer and executive vice president at J.B. Hunt. “Collaboration between the public and private sectors will be critical to understanding how electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles and other emerging technologies are implemented. Beyond that, it displays a collective desire and commitment to finding long-term solutions that will impact the transportation industry and ultimately the motoring public.”

With the creation of more jobs available in relevant fields such as electrical and aerospace engineering, manufacturing and IT, student and employee retention are anticipated to increase.

“The University of Arkansas is excited to see this interest and investment in this important growth area,” Dr. Alan Mantooth, University of Arkansas distinguished professor of electrical engineering, said. “As the only institution with a silicon carbide (SiC) research and fabrication facility, and very high research activity, the U of A is uniquely positioned to support this effort with the ability to produce world-class applied research and innovations in power electronics, energy systems, logistics and supply chain, and cybersecurity. The University of Arkansas is proud to be a part of this effort to support the State's emerging smart mobility sector, providing research, technologies and well-prepared workforce.”

Furthermore, Runway Group has made a multi-million-dollar investment in this initiative. These investments will spark local economic vitality, leading to vibrant and dynamic communities across the state. Arkansas is well-positioned to become a hub for advanced mobility business clusters. The mobility market is expected to attract young startup companies and provide them with tools to prototype, test and scale new technologies and ultimately support their success.

For Arkansas residents, the investment in the future of transportation will bridge the urban-rural divide, allowing for greater connectivity and accessibility across the state. New opportunities will emerge for healthcare, medical suppliers and first responders support by allowing providers to bring medications and supplies to the patient, rather than move the patient to the medicine.

“This effort exemplifies the bold ideas and collaboration transforming Arkansas into a hub for innovation,” said Nelson Peacock, president and CEO of the Northwest Arkansas Council. “As more companies choose Arkansas as the home base for their cutting-edge technologies, these investments will revolutionize our workforce, create jobs and shape an innovative culture that propels the local economy forward.”

Opportunities for applications of mobility technologies will be available across a variety of industries, such as agriculture and timber, infrastructure inspections and tourism. The next-gen technology is also expected to reduce Arkansas’ carbon footprint. By providing cleaner air and quieter streets, The Natural State will benefit from a strong and healthy environment.

Arkansas’ commitment to advancing transportation and logistics has garnered support from organizations across the state, including the State of Arkansas, UP.Partners, Runway Group, Arkansas Aerospace and Defense Alliance, J.B. Hunt, Walmart, the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce, the University of Arkansas, Northwest Arkansas Council, FedEx, and Entergy.

MIAMI, Feb. 22, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Doroni Aerospace, Inc. recently reached $500,000 in investments as part of its crowdfunding raise on the equity investment platform, StartEngine. This marks the official halfway point for the $1M maximum offering for this raise.

Launched by Howard Mark’s, co-founder of video game giant Activision, and backed by renowned investment guru Kevin O’Leary, AKA “Mr. Wonderful” from ABC’s Shark Tank television show, StartEngine enables everyday people to become angel investors by giving them access to startup opportunities across a wide range of industries.

Doroni also recently announced its new research and development facility in the Miami area, which will work in tandem with several facilities across the country to produce components and systems for the H1. With the production of the H1 P1 full-scale showroom model underway at the new facility, Doroni also announced it will begin sharing week-to-week video updates of the production process via its YouTube channel and StartEngine campaign page.

Since 2016, Doroni has been driven by the goal of bringing safe and consumer-focused air transportation to the emerging electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft industry. The company’s go market vehicle—the Doroni H1 eVTOL—utilizes an intuitive and easy-to-use control system that simplifies the inherent complexities of airplane or helicopter flight. The H1’s quick deployment and propulsion will make it an extremely agile vehicle with a variety of use cases, particularly in emergency services and military support.

With an anticipated launch date in the second half of 2024, Doroni will be seeking a Light-Sport Aircraft (LSA) certification with the FAA, which is markedly different from its air taxi competitors. At launch the H1 will retail for $135K, be able to park and charge in a standard two car garage, and owners will only require a valid driver’s license and completion of a 15-hour student pilot training course provided by the company.

Doroni placed second at the Florida Aerospace 2021 Forum, garnered the support of government agency Space Florida to help bring production to scale, and recently signed an NDA with Honeywell Aerospace for components and/or systems to be used with the H1.

Doroni’s recent progress has also been featured in Ami Magazine and FutureFlight , and the company’s CEO/Founder, Doron Merdinger, recently sat down with Alex Scerri of eVTOL.com —one of the leading digital sources of news on the eVTOL and Urban Air Mobility markets. You can read the full Q&A here .

Doron will also serve as a keynote speaker at World BI’s #Futureonthewings Virtual Conference this April 27th , covering the anticipated launch of H1 eVTOL as it relates to the industry as a whole."

Putin of Russia announced on television that he had decided “to carry out a special military operation” in Ukraine, explosions were reported across the country.

Blasts were heard in Kyiv, the capital; in Kharkiv, the second largest city; and in Kramatorsk in the region of Donetsk, one of two eastern Ukrainian territories claimed by Russia-backed separatists since 2014.

Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian troops had landed in the southern port city of Odessa and were crossing from Russia into Kharkiv. Footage captured by security cameras showed Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine from Crimea, the peninsula that Russia seized in 2014.

Rocket attacks targeted Ukrainian fighter jets parked at an airport outside Kyiv, and Ukraine closed its airspace to commercial flights, citing the “potential hazard to civilian aviation.”

More than 40 Ukrainian soldiers were killed and dozens were wounded in the fighting on Thursday morning, said Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.

As air raid sirens blared in Kyiv, the western city of Lviv and other urban areas, residents rushed to take shelter in bus and subway stations. In Kyiv, people packed up their cars and waited in long lines to fill up with gas on their way out of the city. In eastern Ukraine, early signs of panic appeared on the streets as lines formed at A.T.M.s and gas stations.

With attacks across the country, it quickly became clear that Russia’s campaign, whatever Mr. Putin meant by a “special military operation,” was aimed at far more than the rebel territories in the east. Within an hour, Ukraine’s state emergency service said that attacks had been launched in 10 regions of Ukraine, primarily in the east and south, and that reports of new shelling were “coming in constantly.”

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, called it “a full-scale invasion of Ukraine” and said his country would defend itself, while calling on the world to “stop Putin.”

Russia’s Defense Ministry said that it was using “high-precision weapons” to disable military infrastructure, air defense facilities, military airfields and Ukrainian army planes, Russia’s state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. But the ministry said it was not attacking cities, and promised that “the civilian population is not at risk.”

The Ukrainian authorities said that invading naval forces were coming ashore at multiple points, including in Kharkiv and the southern city of Kherson. Three emergency workers were injured when a command post was struck by shelling in Nizhyn, in the north, and six people were trapped under rubble when the city’s airport came under attack, Ukraine’s Interior Ministry reported.

Military depots, warehouses and National Guard were hit with artillery blasts, the ministry said.

As dawn broke in Kyiv, Mr. Zelensky of Ukraine said he had declared martial law. The country’s defense minister told citizens that the army was “fending off enemy forces” and “doing everything it can to protect you.”

But the army was under siege. In the east, Russia-backed separatists — their ranks bolstered by the arrival of hundreds of Russian mercenaries in recent days, according to European officials — said they were hammering Ukrainian troops along the entire 250-mile front line that has divided the rebels and Ukrainian forces since 2014.

Seeking to capture the entire territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, which Mr. Putin recognized as independent on Monday, the rebels were “using all weapons at their disposal,” the Russian news media reported. Ukrainian officials said the attacks included artillery strikes.

Ukraine’s state border service reported that Russian troops stationed in Belarus, north of Ukraine, had launched an attack with support from the Belarusian military. Russia had deployed as many as 30,000 troops to Belarus for exercises this month that the United States warned could provide cover for an attack against Kyiv, which lies a fast 140-mile drive away from a main border crossing. President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus denied that his forces were involved.

By midmorning in Kyiv, Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had disabled all of Ukraine’s air defenses and air bases. Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian forces had captured two villages in the Luhansk region.

The fighting intensified as Ukrainian forces shot down six Russian fighters and a helicopter in a fight to maintain control over key cities, a senior Ukrainian military official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to release information outside official channels. Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, called on all Ukrainian civilians to join the fight and enlist with territorial defense units.

“Ukraine is moving into all-out defense mode,” he said."

(“NFI”), a leading independent bus and coach manufacturer and a leader in electric mass mobility solutions, subsidiary Alexander Dennis Limited (“ADL”) and BYD UK jointly announced today that their electric vehicle partnership will supply over 130 battery-electric double deck buses to EV fleet and battery storage specialist Zenobē and National Express, and will support these vehicles with spare parts over a period of 16 years.

The deal will see over 130 BYD ADL Enviro400EV double deck electric buses, all manufactured in Britain by ADL in partnership with BYD, enter service in Coventry from early 2023 as a part of the city’s successful bid to become the country’s first all-electric bus city and take it a huge step closer to replacing around 300 diesel vehicles by 2025.

Zenobē will be providing Electric Transportation as a Service (“ETaaS”) to National Express, financing and managing the full turnkey solution that includes new BYD ADL vehicles, on-board battery replacement, charging and grid infrastructure, a second-life battery system at the depot, unique software to optimise charging, parts, and full operational support.

As part of the agreement, ADL will supply Zenobē and National Express with spare parts for planned preventive maintenance (“PPM”) over a period of 16 years from acceptance of the vehicles.

The work builds on ADL and Zenobē’s existing partnership with National Express, previously providing charging infrastructure and batteries for 29 BYD ADL Enviro400EV electric buses in Coventry and Birmingham in 2020. The project will be financed partly through the partnership between Zenobē and National Express, with some investment also coming from the £50 million grant from the Department of Transport, awarded to the West Midlands Combined Authority for Coventry’s all-electric bus city scheme, enabling the public purse to go further.

“As the UK’s leading provider of electric buses, we are delighted to be part of this ETaaS deal with partners Zenobē and National Express,” said Paul Davies, President and Managing Director, ADL. “This innovative model brings together government funding and business innovation to deliver an affordable way of rolling out zero-emission bus fleets at scale. The country will further benefit from the choice of 130 British-built vehicles that ensure money is reinvested into the manufacturing sector and local communities, where they support skilled jobs and apprenticeships at our own facilities, as well as in our extensive supply chain.”

“This really is a globally important deal,” said Steven Meersman, Co-founder and Director, Zenobē. “We are incredibly excited to be leading the way for the electric bus industry, with ETaaS revolutionising the way fleets are electrified. By retaining ownership of the vehicles and taking on the risk of switching to zero-emission, we are giving National Express the use of an electric bus fleet without the hassle of owning one, making the transition to a zero-emission fleet more financially desirable. We’re excited to use our new model to help many more operators and local authorities across the UK – and the world – transition to electric, and ultimately accelerate progress towards net zero and clean air.”

“This ground-breaking partnership with Zenobē further demonstrates our leadership as National Express takes another significant step towards our fully zero emission bus fleet ambition,” said Tom Stables, CEO, National Express UK and Germany. “Through this pioneering new way of working, Zenobē's innovative solution provides us with the reliability and flexibility we need to accelerate the roll-out of our greener, cleaner vehicles, while we focus on delivering an excellent service for the people of Coventry. Buses are already one of the cleanest ways to travel. National Express is making it even cleaner, cheaper and easier, so our new and existing customers can relax knowing that they are doing their bit for the planet if they leave the car at home and travel by bus.”

“The issue of climate change is one that requires immediate action,” said Frank Thorpe, Managing Director, BYD UK. “We believe that this arrangement is a positive, more viable way forward for many public transport operators to swiftly integrate and transition to zero-emission pure-electric bus solutions. National Express has first-hand experience operating BYD ADL eBuses, which utilise BYD’s pioneering battery and integrated electronic technology. With a longstanding knowledge of the UK market, BYD is especially proud to be involved in this project, which is setting a precedent for a new way of accelerating and financing eMobility for a better, greener world.”

An independent news and commentary website produced by academics and journalists.

It’s a popular idea that the path to sustainability lies in high-tech solutions. By making everyday items like cars electric, and installing smart systems to monitor and reduce energy use, it seems we’ll still be able to enjoy the comforts to which we’ve become accustomed while doing our bit for the planet – a state known as “green growth”.

But the risks of this approach are becoming ever clearer. Many modern technologies use materials like copper, cobalt, lithium and rare earth elements. These metals are in devices like cell phones, televisions, and motors. Not only is their supply finite, but large amounts of energy are required for their extraction and processing – producing significant emissions.

Plus, many of these devices are inherently difficult to recycle. This is because to make them, complex mixes of materials are created, often in very small quantities. It’s very expensive to collect and separate them for recycling.

Among others, these limitations have led some to question the high-tech direction our society is taking – and to develop a burgeoning interest in low-tech solutions. These solutions prioritize simplicity and durability, local manufacture, as well as traditional or ancient techniques.

What’s more, low-tech solutions often focus on conviviality. This involves encouraging social connections, for example through communal music or dance, rather than fostering the hyper-individualism encouraged by resource-hungry digital devices.

“Low-tech” does not mean a return to medieval ways of living. But it does demand more discernment in our choice of technologies – and consideration of their disadvantages.

Origins of low-tech

Critics have proclaimed the downsides of excessive technology for centuries, from 19th century Luddites to 20th-century writers like Jacques Ellul and Lewis Mumford. But it was the western energy crisis in the 1970s that really popularised these ideas.

Low-tech emphasizes efficiency and simplicity. Image: CityHarvestNY/Wikimedia

British economist E.F. Schumacher’s 1973 book Small is Beautiful presented a powerful critique of modern technology and its depletion of resources like fossil fuels. Instead, Schumacher advocated for simplicity: locally affordable, efficient technologies (which he termed “intermediate” technologies), like small hydroelectricity devices used by rural communities.

Schumacher’s mantle has been taken up by a growing movement calling itself “low-tech”. Belgian writer Kris de Dekker’s online Low-Tech Magazine has been cataloging low-tech solutions, such as windmills that use friction to heat buildings, since 2007. In particular, the magazine explores obsolete technologies that could still contribute to a sustainable society: like fruit walls used in the 1600s to create local, warm microclimates for growing Mediterranean fruits.

In the US, architect, and academic Julia Watson’s book Lo-TEK (where TEK stands for Traditional Ecological Knowledge) explores traditional technologies from using reeds as building materials to creating wetlands for wastewater treatment.

And in France, engineer Philippe Bihouix’s realization of technology’s drain on resources led to his prize-winning book The Age of Low Tech. First published in 2014, it describes what life in a low-tech world might be like, including radically cutting consumption.

Principles of low-tech include efficiency, durability, and accessibility. Image: Arthur Keller and Emilien Bournigal/Wikimedia

Bihouix presents seven “commandments” of the low-tech movement. Among others, these cover the need to balance a technology’s performance with its environmental impact, being cautious of automation (especially where employment is replaced by increased energy use), and reducing our demands on nature.

But the first principle of low-tech is its emphasis on sobriety: avoiding excessive or frivolous consumption, and being satisfied by less beautiful models with lower performance. As Bihouix writes:

A reduction in consumption could make it quickly possible to rediscover the many simple, poetic, philosophical joys of a revitalised natural world … while the reduction in stress and working time would make it possible to develop many cultural or leisure activities such as shows, theatre, music, gardening or yoga.

Ancient solutions

Crucially, we can apply low-tech principles to our daily lives now. For example, we can easily reduce energy demand from heating by using warm clothes and blankets. Food, if it’s packaged at all, can be bought and stored in reusable, recyclable packaging like glass.

Architecture offers multiple opportunities for low-tech approaches, especially if we learn from history. Using ancient windcatcher towers designed to allow external cool air to flow through rooms lets buildings be cooled using much less energy than air conditioning. And storing heat in stones, used by the Romans for underfloor heating, is being considered today as a means of dealing with the intermittency of renewable energy.

Design and manufacture for sustainability emphasize reducing waste, often through avoiding mixing and contaminating materials. Simple materials like plain carbon steels, joined using removable fasteners, are easy to recycle and locally repair. Buses, trains, and farm machinery using these steels, for example, can be much more readily refurbished or recycled than modern cars full of microelectronics and manufactured from sophisticated alloys.

In some places, the principles of low tech are already influencing urban design and industrial policy. Examples include “15-minute cities” where shops and other amenities are easily accessible to residents, using cargo bikes instead of cars or vans for deliveries, and encouraging repairable products through right-to-repair legislation in the EU and US.

Meanwhile, in Japan, there’s emerging interest in the reuse and recycling practices of the Edo period. From 1603 to 1867, the country was effectively closed to the outside world, with very limited access to raw materials. Therefore, extensive reuse and repair – even of things such as broken pottery or utensils with holes that we’d now regard as waste – became a way of life. Specialist repairers would mend or recycle everything from paper lanterns and books to shoes, pans, umbrellas, and candles.

By following examples like these, we can make discerning technological choices a central part of our search for sustainable ways of living.

The offering enables individuals to invest in the SFR and BTR asset class, one of commercial real estate’s fastest growing and most in-demand sectors. Representing approximately 17 percent of the overall single-family housing market, the SFR asset class has seen significant institutional investment, driving increased competition and creating higher barriers to entry for individual investors.1

AHV Communities (AHV), a leading, vertically integrated developer and operator with extensive experience in the build-to-rent asset class, is part of the project’s sponsorship group. Affiliates of ArborCrowd, AHV and MDO Capital, a commercial real estate finance firm, have collectively funded 30 percent of the deal’s total equity. Arbor Commercial Mortgage, a national direct lender and member of The Arbor Family of Companies alongside ArborCrowd, provided a $46.24 million loan to finance the construction of the project. ArborCrowd now seeks to raise $10.79 million from investors for the remaining equity, which an ArborCrowd affiliate has prefunded into the transaction. The project is expected to break ground in 2022 and complete construction in 2024.

The Selby Ranch deal is an especially attractive investment opportunity due to:

The continued prominence and growth of the single-family build-to-rent asset class, which has seen more than $45 billion of institutional investment in 2021 and 14.7 percent year-over-year national rent growth ending in October 2021. 2,3

Strong sponsorship in AHV, an experienced developer of build-to-rent communities having developed 13 communities containing over 2,200 homes since 2013.

The Arbor Family of Companies’ unparalleled experience in single-family rentals, having pioneered a specific lending program for the asset class in 2019.

The alignment of interests between ArborCrowd and investors in the deal’s capital stack, in which a member of its management team is also personally invested.

Colorado Springs’ booming metro area, which has experienced population and employment growth far exceeding national rates over the past decade.

“Our expansion into the single-family build-to-rent asset class represents a significant step in ArborCrowd’s broader evolution by enabling us to offer individual investors coveted access to a highly sought-after property type,” said Co-Founder and COO Adam Kaufman. “By breaking down the barriers to entry for investing in single-family rentals and capitalizing on the incredible demand for these communities across the nation – particularly in secondary and tertiary markets – we’re affording investors opportunities to generate the returns they seek. Moreover, as one of the first institutions to focus heavily in the space, our management team is uniquely positioned to evaluate and invest in single-family build-to-rent projects.”

Mr. Kaufman continued, “Selby Ranch in particular is an ideal project to launch our first investment offering in the single-family rental space as it meets our rigorous underwriting requirements and provides exposure to the thriving Colorado Springs market, which features a distinct balance between suburban and urban lifestyles. As factors that include rising home prices, remote work trends, migration to suburban locations and an aging millennial population continue to drive interest in single-family rentals, we see significant growth for this asset class on the horizon.”

Once completed, Selby Ranch will feature 163 three- and four-bedroom units with an average size of 1,310 square feet. Spanning roughly 13.2 acres, the townhome-style single-family units will be spread across 47 buildings and include attached two-car garages, stainless steel appliances, and central air conditioning. Proposed shared amenities consist of a community clubhouse, pool, fitness center and children’s play area.

The Colorado Springs Metropolitan Statistical Area (“Colorado Springs MSA”) is the second largest in Colorado after Denver, with a population that’s expected to grow to nearly 770,500 residents by 2026.4 Its high quality of life, vibrant downtown, affordability and flourishing business climate, which is bolstered by major employers including Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon and L3 Harris Technologies, have contributed to population growth that has doubled the national average from 2010 to 2021.4 Additionally, Colorado Springs offers numerous highlights for residents, including more than 50 major outdoor attractions and parks, the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Museum and Pike’s Peak, one of America’s most prominent mountains.

Putin of Russia announced on television that he had decided “to carry out a special military operation” in Ukraine, explosions were reported across the country.

Blasts were heard in Kyiv, the capital; in Kharkiv, the second largest city; and in Kramatorsk in the region of Donetsk, one of two eastern Ukrainian territories claimed by Russia-backed separatists since 2014.

Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian troops had landed in the southern port city of Odessa and were crossing from Russia into Kharkiv. Footage captured by security cameras showed Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine from Crimea, the peninsula that Russia seized in 2014.

Rocket attacks targeted Ukrainian fighter jets parked at an airport outside Kyiv, and Ukraine closed its airspace to commercial flights, citing the “potential hazard to civilian aviation.”

More than 40 Ukrainian soldiers were killed and dozens were wounded in the fighting on Thursday morning, said Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.

As air raid sirens blared in Kyiv, the western city of Lviv and other urban areas, residents rushed to take shelter in bus and subway stations. In Kyiv, people packed up their cars and waited in long lines to fill up with gas on their way out of the city. In eastern Ukraine, early signs of panic appeared on the streets as lines formed at A.T.M.s and gas stations.

With attacks across the country, it quickly became clear that Russia’s campaign, whatever Mr. Putin meant by a “special military operation,” was aimed at far more than the rebel territories in the east. Within an hour, Ukraine’s state emergency service said that attacks had been launched in 10 regions of Ukraine, primarily in the east and south, and that reports of new shelling were “coming in constantly.”

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, called it “a full-scale invasion of Ukraine” and said his country would defend itself, while calling on the world to “stop Putin.”

Russia’s Defense Ministry said that it was using “high-precision weapons” to disable military infrastructure, air defense facilities, military airfields and Ukrainian army planes, Russia’s state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. But the ministry said it was not attacking cities, and promised that “the civilian population is not at risk.”

The Ukrainian authorities said that invading naval forces were coming ashore at multiple points, including in Kharkiv and the southern city of Kherson. Three emergency workers were injured when a command post was struck by shelling in Nizhyn, in the north, and six people were trapped under rubble when the city’s airport came under attack, Ukraine’s Interior Ministry reported.

Military depots, warehouses and National Guard were hit with artillery blasts, the ministry said.

As dawn broke in Kyiv, Mr. Zelensky of Ukraine said he had declared martial law. The country’s defense minister told citizens that the army was “fending off enemy forces” and “doing everything it can to protect you.”

But the army was under siege. In the east, Russia-backed separatists — their ranks bolstered by the arrival of hundreds of Russian mercenaries in recent days, according to European officials — said they were hammering Ukrainian troops along the entire 250-mile front line that has divided the rebels and Ukrainian forces since 2014.

Seeking to capture the entire territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, which Mr. Putin recognized as independent on Monday, the rebels were “using all weapons at their disposal,” the Russian news media reported. Ukrainian officials said the attacks included artillery strikes.

Ukraine’s state border service reported that Russian troops stationed in Belarus, north of Ukraine, had launched an attack with support from the Belarusian military. Russia had deployed as many as 30,000 troops to Belarus for exercises this month that the United States warned could provide cover for an attack against Kyiv, which lies a fast 140-mile drive away from a main border crossing. President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus denied that his forces were involved.

By midmorning in Kyiv, Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had disabled all of Ukraine’s air defenses and air bases. Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian forces had captured two villages in the Luhansk region.

The fighting intensified as Ukrainian forces shot down six Russian fighters and a helicopter in a fight to maintain control over key cities, a senior Ukrainian military official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to release information outside official channels. Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, called on all Ukrainian civilians to join the fight and enlist with territorial defense units.

“Ukraine is moving into all-out defense mode,” he said."

NEW YORK, February 23, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ArborCrowd, the first crowdfunding platform launched by a real estate institution, today announced a new offering that allows investors to acquire equity interests in Selby Ranch, a single-family rental (SFR) and build-to-rent (BTR) development located in Colorado Springs, Colo. with a total capitalization of $61.65 million. The offering enables individuals to invest in the SFR and BTR asset class, one of commercial real estate’s fastest growing and most in-demand sectors. Representing approximately 17 percent of the overall single-family housing market, the SFR asset class has seen significant institutional investment, driving increased competition and creating higher barriers to entry for individual investors.1

AHV Communities (AHV), a leading, vertically integrated developer and operator with extensive experience in the build-to-rent asset class, is part of the project’s sponsorship group. Affiliates of ArborCrowd, AHV and MDO Capital, a commercial real estate finance firm, have collectively funded 30 percent of the deal’s total equity. Arbor Commercial Mortgage, a national direct lender and member of The Arbor Family of Companies alongside ArborCrowd, provided a $46.24 million loan to finance the construction of the project. ArborCrowd now seeks to raise $10.79 million from investors for the remaining equity, which an ArborCrowd affiliate has prefunded into the transaction. The project is expected to break ground in 2022 and complete construction in 2024.

The Selby Ranch deal is an especially attractive investment opportunity due to:

The continued prominence and growth of the single-family build-to-rent asset class, which has seen more than $45 billion of institutional investment in 2021 and 14.7 percent year-over-year national rent growth ending in October 2021. 2,3

Strong sponsorship in AHV, an experienced developer of build-to-rent communities having developed 13 communities containing over 2,200 homes since 2013.

The Arbor Family of Companies’ unparalleled experience in single-family rentals, having pioneered a specific lending program for the asset class in 2019.

The alignment of interests between ArborCrowd and investors in the deal’s capital stack, in which a member of its management team is also personally invested.

Colorado Springs’ booming metro area, which has experienced population and employment growth far exceeding national rates over the past decade.

Story continues

""Our expansion into the single-family build-to-rent asset class represents a significant step in ArborCrowd’s broader evolution by enabling us to offer individual investors coveted access to a highly sought-after property type,"" said Co-Founder and COO Adam Kaufman. ""By breaking down the barriers to entry for investing in single-family rentals and capitalizing on the incredible demand for these communities across the nation – particularly in secondary and tertiary markets – we’re affording investors opportunities to generate the returns they seek. Moreover, as one of the first institutions to focus heavily in the space, our management team is uniquely positioned to evaluate and invest in single-family build-to-rent projects.""

Mr. Kaufman continued, ""Selby Ranch in particular is an ideal project to launch our first investment offering in the single-family rental space as it meets our rigorous underwriting requirements and provides exposure to the thriving Colorado Springs market, which features a distinct balance between suburban and urban lifestyles. As factors that include rising home prices, remote work trends, migration to suburban locations and an aging millennial population continue to drive interest in single-family rentals, we see significant growth for this asset class on the horizon.""

Once completed, Selby Ranch will feature 163 three- and four-bedroom units with an average size of 1,310 square feet. Spanning roughly 13.2 acres, the townhome-style single-family units will be spread across 47 buildings and include attached two-car garages, stainless steel appliances, and central air conditioning. Proposed shared amenities consist of a community clubhouse, pool, fitness center and children’s play area.

The Colorado Springs Metropolitan Statistical Area (""Colorado Springs MSA"") is the second largest in Colorado after Denver, with a population that’s expected to grow to nearly 770,500 residents by 2026.4 Its high quality of life, vibrant downtown, affordability and flourishing business climate, which is bolstered by major employers including Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon and L3 Harris Technologies, have contributed to population growth that has doubled the national average from 2010 to 2021.4 Additionally, Colorado Springs offers numerous highlights for residents, including more than 50 major outdoor attractions and parks, the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Museum and Pike’s Peak, one of America’s most prominent mountains.

But Joby is a high-risk stock. So my investment here is tiny (way under 1% of my family investment portfolio).

I'm bullish on this stock because I'm negative about self-driving cars. I don't think the collective intelligence at Alphabet or Tesla can sufficiently plan for all the variables of driving a car in the street. Even if the artificial intelligence-based technology works and reduces car collisions, every accident is a major lawsuit waiting to happen. For example, suppose Tesla manages to reduce the accident rate from 6 million a year (the total number of car accidents in 2018 in the U.S. and assuming all cars are self driven) to 1 million -- which would be incredible -- that's still 1 million lawsuits a year the company will face.

Joby, meanwhile, is changing the transportation landscape in a three-dimensional way. There's almost zero traffic in the sky. The vehicles are way faster and just as quiet. I think Joby could easily go up 10 times in value, just with human pilots. But if robots start flying those things? The sky's the limit.

So I'm investing in Joby now, even though the company has neither earnings nor revenues yet. Why so soon? Because when you're shooting for a 100-bagger, you don't need (or want) a large initial investment. There are so many things that could go wrong, you might lose everything. But the potential upside is so high, it's worth making small investments now before the crowd wakes up and bids up the stock price.

A couple of 100-baggers will make you rich

While a 100-bagger seems impossibly big, it actually happens fairly often. For instance, if you bought shares of Apple in 2004, after the iPod but before the iPhone, you'd have made over 400 times your money by now.

That's nothing compared to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and its insane 3,000-bagger in 35 years.

Here's a short list of some of the stocks that have pulled off the 100-bagger feat:

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)

Walmart (NYSE:WMT)

Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG)

Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)

Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)

Nike (NYSE:NKE)

McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)

If you do the math, you'll see that even a tiny investment in a 100-bagger can make you rich. The 20-year-old college student who bought $500 worth of Microsoft back in 1986 is now a millionaire, just from that one stock buy. So that's why it's worth your time to search for companies chasing massive opportunities, and make small investments while the stock price is still tiny, and the future is uncertain.

How big is the market for air taxis?

A couple of years ago, Morgan Stanley put out a research report that estimates the market for air taxis to reach $1.5 trillion by 2040. It's not hard to see why transportation will go vertical in the future. Joby's aircraft is electric and recently demonstrated how quiet the aircraft, a critical parameter to operate in populated areas. At about 55 decibels during take-off, it's more than a thousand times quieter than a typical helicopter. And that's kind of amazing, because these vehicles are super-fast. How fast? The company's air taxi hit 205 miles an hour in a practice run earlier this year.

The company also demonstrated that the aircraft can fly 150 miles on a single battery charge. The plan is to use them to ferry passengers in and around congested cities. Los Angeles, for instance, is known for its heavy traffic. Electric cars do not fix that problem. Self-driving cars don't fix that problem, either. Nobody likes a traffic snarl, and anything that reduces those bottlenecks will be a blessing. Joby estimates the market for its air taxis in L.A. at $500 million a year. That's just one city!

Tesla in the sky?

How big is the air taxi opportunity? Well, if you don't believe Morgan Stanley's $1.5 trillion number, consider what Elon Musk has to say.

So, over time, we think full self-driving will become the most important source of profitability for Tesla. It's -- actually, if you run the numbers on robotaxis, it's kind of nutty -- it's nutty good from a financial standpoint.

That's thought-provoking. Musk is happy about his fleet of electric cars and his $53 billion in revenues. But he believes self-driving taxis is actually a much bigger opportunity in the future.

Try to imagine investing in Tesla back in 2010, when the company had its initial public offering (IPO). It was a daunting investment. Tesla had no profits and had only sold 1,000 cars in total when the company went public. If the company had suffered a few bad breaks a decade ago, it could have easily gone Chapter 11.

Joby in 2022 is much like Tesla in 2010 -- a highly risky investment opportunity with a huge potential upside. The way you approach a dangerous stock like this is by making a small investment now, and maybe adding to your position as the dangers recede and the market gets more and more excited.

Uber in the sky?

Of course, when you think ""taxis,"" you think Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), the company that disrupted the taxi industry around the world. You might think Uber would be interested in that $1.5 trillion market opportunity, too. And you'd be right. Back in 2016, Uber published a white paper about the future of urban air transportation. Two years later, the ride-sharing giant introduced its prototype vehicle. But Uber was too late to the party, and so in 2020 the company abandoned the race and sold out to Joby (and invested $75 million in the start-up).

Similarly, Toyota decided to invest almost $400 million in Joby last year. That's a major influx of cash. After several financing rounds and its SPAC last year, Joby is now sitting on $1.6 billion dollars.

So here we have a huge market opportunity. Uber sees it, and Toyota sees it. And yet these two massive companies both decided to back Joby instead of going alone. Why?

Joby has a powerful first-mover advantage. The company has been working on its aircraft for over a decade and has been collaborating with NASA since 2012. Joby's near-term goals are to get its aircraft certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), scale up its manufacturing, and launch its air taxi service in 2024. It's in the lead and likely to be first to market in the U.S.

What about self-driving air taxis?

I think Musk's vision of robotaxis in the future is very exciting. But given the congestion in the cities and the pain-points that air taxis solve, I believe this revolution may very well happen in the air first. After all, the first autopilots in aircraft were introduced in 1912! We already have drones in the air. The safety issues with a self-driving aircraft are minuscule compared to the complexities on the ground.

So that's why I've made a tiny investment in Joby Aviation now, even with a significant possibility that I might lose it all. The long-term upside is so massive, I want to have a minor ownership now, in the hopes that Joby can pull off what the company is trying to do."

Putin of Russia announced on television that he had decided “to carry out a special military operation” in Ukraine, explosions were reported across the country.

Blasts were heard in Kyiv, the capital; in Kharkiv, the second largest city; and in Kramatorsk in the region of Donetsk, one of two eastern Ukrainian territories claimed by Russia-backed separatists since 2014.

Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian troops had landed in the southern port city of Odessa and were crossing from Russia into Kharkiv. Footage captured by security cameras showed Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine from Crimea, the peninsula that Russia seized in 2014.

Rocket attacks targeted Ukrainian fighter jets parked at an airport outside Kyiv, and Ukraine closed its airspace to commercial flights, citing the “potential hazard to civilian aviation.”

More than 40 Ukrainian soldiers were killed and dozens were wounded in the fighting on Thursday morning, said Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.

As air raid sirens blared in Kyiv, the western city of Lviv and other urban areas, residents rushed to take shelter in bus and subway stations. In Kyiv, people packed up their cars and waited in long lines to fill up with gas on their way out of the city. In eastern Ukraine, early signs of panic appeared on the streets as lines formed at A.T.M.s and gas stations.

With attacks across the country, it quickly became clear that Russia’s campaign, whatever Mr. Putin meant by a “special military operation,” was aimed at far more than the rebel territories in the east. Within an hour, Ukraine’s state emergency service said that attacks had been launched in 10 regions of Ukraine, primarily in the east and south, and that reports of new shelling were “coming in constantly.”

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, called it “a full-scale invasion of Ukraine” and said his country would defend itself, while calling on the world to “stop Putin.”

Russia’s Defense Ministry said that it was using “high-precision weapons” to disable military infrastructure, air defense facilities, military airfields and Ukrainian army planes, Russia’s state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. But the ministry said it was not attacking cities, and promised that “the civilian population is not at risk.”

The Ukrainian authorities said that invading naval forces were coming ashore at multiple points, including in Kharkiv and the southern city of Kherson. Three emergency workers were injured when a command post was struck by shelling in Nizhyn, in the north, and six people were trapped under rubble when the city’s airport came under attack, Ukraine’s Interior Ministry reported.

Military depots, warehouses and National Guard were hit with artillery blasts, the ministry said.

As dawn broke in Kyiv, Mr. Zelensky of Ukraine said he had declared martial law. The country’s defense minister told citizens that the army was “fending off enemy forces” and “doing everything it can to protect you.”

But the army was under siege. In the east, Russia-backed separatists — their ranks bolstered by the arrival of hundreds of Russian mercenaries in recent days, according to European officials — said they were hammering Ukrainian troops along the entire 250-mile front line that has divided the rebels and Ukrainian forces since 2014.

Seeking to capture the entire territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, which Mr. Putin recognized as independent on Monday, the rebels were “using all weapons at their disposal,” the Russian news media reported. Ukrainian officials said the attacks included artillery strikes.

Ukraine’s state border service reported that Russian troops stationed in Belarus, north of Ukraine, had launched an attack with support from the Belarusian military. Russia had deployed as many as 30,000 troops to Belarus for exercises this month that the United States warned could provide cover for an attack against Kyiv, which lies a fast 140-mile drive away from a main border crossing. President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus denied that his forces were involved.

By midmorning in Kyiv, Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had disabled all of Ukraine’s air defenses and air bases. Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian forces had captured two villages in the Luhansk region.

The fighting intensified as Ukrainian forces shot down six Russian fighters and a helicopter in a fight to maintain control over key cities, a senior Ukrainian military official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to release information outside official channels. Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, called on all Ukrainian civilians to join the fight and enlist with territorial defense units.

“Ukraine is moving into all-out defense mode,” he said."

Here’s how it will play out.

The world won’t know what Russian President Vladimir Putin wants until the day after war breaks out with Ukraine.

Day one will be confused. Deliberately so. Accusations will be flying thick and fast – alongside the missiles and artillery shells crisscrossing Ukraine’s borders with Russia and Belarus.

Who is to blame won’t matter. The outcome will be the same. Moscow’s well-prepared force of 170,000 troops will be poised to roll into a neighbouring country in what will be the biggest military action in Europe since World War II.

Ukraine has nothing to gain from provoking such a move. Its much smaller army is heavily outgunned. At best, it can only hope to extract a blood price for every kilometre it surrenders to a Russian advance.

Day two will likely bring more clarity. The main thrust of Moscow’s forces will probably have become evident. And that will shape the future of world relations for decades to come.

President Putin’s goal is likely to be no different from his other recent aggressive acts.

“The Kremlin’s primary goal is a guarantee that Belarus, Ukraine, and Georgia will never belong to a military or economic bloc other than the one Moscow controls and that Russia will be the ultimate arbitrator of the foreign and security policy of all three states,” argues Seth Jones, director of the Centre for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) international security program.

As President Putin has repeatedly said: It’s about inalienable sovereign security rights.

Just not those of Ukraine, Belarus or Georgia.

“In essence, this conflict is about whether 30 years after the demise of the Soviet Union, its former ethnic republics can live as independent, sovereign states or if they still must acknowledge Moscow as their de facto sovereign,” he writes.

But how will Putin achieve this?

How far is he willing to go? What is he willing to risk?

Only day two will tell.

Opening moves

President Putin needs an excuse. In military and diplomatic circles, it’s called “casus belli” – a justification for war.

Not that he’s waited.

“We’ve already seen cyberattacks, we’ve already seen information operations – things below the threshold of response have been already happening,” USAF Lieutenant Colonel Tyson Wetzel told a recent Atlantic Council think-tank presentation.

What comes next depends on what Putin wants.

“I think his objective is to take territory to make NATO look feckless,” Lt Col Wetzel said.

Retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman and Lawfare Institute research associate Dominic Cruz Bustillos argue in Foreign Policy that “Russian President Vladimir Putin seeks nothing short of the complete dismantling of Europe’s post – Cold War security architecture and a rollback of fundamental international agreements governing states’ rights to self-determination”.

What comes next depends on Putin’s calculations of risk versus return.

“Presuming that diplomacy fails, there are three scenarios that could play out,” they write. “Which one comes to pass will depend in large part on how Putin decides he can best achieve his ultimate goals: crippling Ukrainian military capabilities, sowing tur

moil in the Ukrainian government, and, ultimately, turning Ukraine into a failed state.”

Only that would suit his narrative. That democracy doesn’t work. That the West is corrupt and cowardly. That Russia’s “sphere of influence” has been restored.

How he intends to achieve it will become evident on day two.

“Over the years, and especially in recent years, they (the Kremlin) never have a linear strategy,” former Ukraine minister for defence Andriy Zagorodnyuk told the Atlantic Council. “So they don’t have like a strategic goal – one plan – on how to reach those goals. They always have options.”

Option One: Coercion

Claims of genocide against Russian-speaking Ukrainian citizens. Claims of atrocities against civilians. Claims of shooting first.

All of these accusations are flooding Kremlin-controlled media right now.

It doesn’t have to lead to an all-out war.

It could produce a military clash – followed by a diplomatic escalation.

“Russia could move to formally recognise or annex the occupied Donbas region of eastern Ukraine,” the Foreign Policy analysts argue.

“This would allow the Kremlin to avoid further military escalation yet still come away with a ‘win’.”

Zagorodnyuk believes a “serious provocation” in the Donbas “which they would blame Ukrainians for” is almost certain. Accusations of a Ukrainian attack on a kindergarten – inside Ukrainian territory – on Thursday night appears to support this expectation.

The government in Kyiv is unlikely to make a similar mistake to that of Tbilisi, Georgia. Its President Mikheil Saakashvili chose to counter-attack a Russian occupation of the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions – giving Moscow an excuse for their own use of force.

With some 170,000 troops arrayed on its borders, Kyiv knows Moscow is spoiling for a fight.

And a loss of the Donbas to occupying Russian forces may end up being to Ukraine’s ultimate advantage.

“If Putin chooses this course, then the United States and NATO may still respond with additional deployments along NATO’s eastern flank, which would bring about the kind of security dilemma that the Kremlin wants to avoid,” write Vindman and Bustillos.

Option Two: Territorial Grab

Ukraine is Europe’s second-largest country – second only to Russia. It has a population of 44 million spread across some 604 million square kilometres.

Seizing it in its entirety would involve a massive effort.

“A second scenario would involve a limited Russian offensive, with limited airpower, to seize additional territory in eastern Ukraine and in the Donbas, perhaps as an extension of recognition or full annexation,” Vindman and Bustillos argue.

That could extend to moves to seize essential ports such as Mariupol and Odesa. Whatever remains of Ukraine would then become landlocked, with any access to key transport corridors entirely at Moscow’s whim.

Such an escalation could be risky.

“Russia would be forced to engage in a costly effort to occupy major Ukrainian cities, exposing its forces to difficult urban warfare, a protracted military campaign, and a costly insurgency,” the analysts write.

“Moreover, seizing and holding terrain for a long-term occupation would weaken Ukraine, but would not result in a failed state.”

It’s a fight Ukraine’s been preparing for since Russia seized its territory of Crimea in 2014.

“I certainly believe they (the Kremlin) are able to put a huge hurt on the Ukrainian populace and take large tracts of territory within the country,” says Lt Col Wetzel.

“I do also think Ukraine – though maybe not having the most advanced weaponry – has been planning for this for a while. And I think they’ll put huge costs on the Russian military.”

It’s a price Putin may have to pay for his past failures.

“If Moscow has learned anything from its failed war in Donbas thus far, it’s that they could not rely on the locals to fight this war for them,” says Herbst.

“So they understand that, in fact, their limited operation in Donbas has turned many of the people in that area against them. And they remember as well that in western Ukraine, at the end of World War II, there was a fierce insurgency that lasted for years. So (the) prediction that the Ukrainian people will rise as a real one.”

Option Three: Seizing Kyiv

Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, is vulnerable. Especially now Russian forces have taken up position in the former Soviet-bloc state of Belarus.

Some estimates put its survival at less than 72 hours after any invasion is launched.

“I think that’s one that makes the most sense,” CNA think-tank Russia studies research director Michael Kofman told the Atlantic Council conference.

“(If) they can install or back some kind of pro-Russian regime in Kyiv, then it won’t be their forces occupying most of Ukraine. They might believe that Ukraine will fragment or that they will be able to simply introduce enough forces to support some sort of pro-Russian regime.”

And that could be one of the gambits that they’re making.”

Putin’s own public statements appear to support this belief.

“If you read anything Putin’s been writing, it suggests that he has not learned much about the social-political dynamics of Ukraine this past year,” says Kofman.

“So maybe you’ve learned it, maybe I have learned that, but we’re not the people making decisions in Moscow. He clearly hasn’t. And it’s in print.”

Putin may believe his own propaganda that Kyiv’s government is a US puppet – and not put there through a general election by the Ukrainian people. He may think Ukrainians may welcome an invasion – with him lauded as a liberator.

“If that’s what he’s thinking, then he’s probably going to make one more classical misperceptions or miscalculations in human history when it comes to decision making on war,” Kofman concludes.

Option Four: All-out invasion

“The … most likely outcome is a full-scale Russian offensive employing land, air, and sea power on all axes of attack,” argue Vindman and Bustillos.

“In this scenario, Russia would establish air and naval superiority as quickly as possible.”

The cities of Kharkiv and Sumy would be among the first targets. At the same time, Russian forces in Crimea and the Donbas would advance along the coast.

Finally, troops based in Belarus could aim to isolate Kyiv.

“To me, Russian forces can probably seize any point they want Ukraine,” says Atlantic Council director Ambassador John Herbst.

“But their ability to hold them, their ability to sustain casualties, is another question.”

That’s not a question that would likely have reached Putin’s ears, he adds.

“When you’re talking about the top officials near Putin, I don’t think this will affect their calculations. They will care more about the power dynamic in the Kremlin and the fact that Putin has overwhelming control of decision making.”

But permanent occupation may not be Putin’s goal.

A long-term occupation would be costly in lives and equipment.

Instead, say Vindman and Bustillos, Moscow may simply want to cause as much damage as possible before withdrawing – and leave a fractured Ukrainian government and its Western supporters to pick up the pieces.

“This operation would focus on punitive strikes on the Ukrainian government, the military, critical infrastructure, and places important to Ukrainians’ national identity and morale,” they write.

“Russia would aim its bombs, rockets, artillery, cruise missiles, and short-range ballistic missiles at targets such as the presidential palace, presidential administrative buildings, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine’s legislature) …”

Such strikes would be catastrophic.

“If all went according to Russia’s plan, the attacks would cripple the Ukrainian government, military, and economic infrastructure — all important steps toward the goal of rendering Ukraine a failed state.”

Resistance forces

Moscow has some 170,000 troops posed to invade Ukraine.

The US-led “Coalition of the Willing” used 177,000 to invade Iraq in 2003.

“So let’s just have a frank conversation about where every single trend you’re looking at is going – in terms of Russian force posture, in terms of equipment on the way, in terms of readiness, in rolling reserve call-ups,” says Kofman.

It show’s Putin is prepared – and confident.

“One of the leading causes of wars is optimism and leaders thinking that they understand the sociopolitical dynamics in other countries – and that the cost of occupation would be cheap, that the operation might go pretty well. You see it all the time.”

But Zagorodnyuk says his Ukrainian people are prepared for this.

“(Russians) don’t need just to get into Ukraine; they also need to stay there,” he says. “Because there’s no point of getting there and then getting out.”

Ambassador Herbst agrees.

“I do know that our intelligence and paramilitary force has been working with Ukraine for quite a long time and training and helping them,” he says.

“So they’ve been planning for this kind of issue for quite a long time. I think there will be a strong effort by the West to try to support an insurgency.”

Ultimately, it depends on what Putin wants.

“His main strategic goal, of course, as we all know, is political survival control at home,” says Ambassador Herbst.

“But he also wants the US out of Europe and pliant, weak states on his periphery.”

As for Russia’s inalienable sovereign security, that will face a dramatically increased threat.

NATO is already moving to reinforce its easternmost member states. Troops, tanks and aircraft are deployed to Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.

It’s considering mobilising new battle groups to oppose Russia’s massed forces.

Neutral Sweden and Finland – both of which showed no interest in joining NATO at the height of the Soviet Cold War – are now seriously discussing the option.

“They see Putin as a serial aggressor,” Herbst says."

We got a glimpse of the redesigned 2023 Genesis G90 sedan in person this week, and it's even more stunning than in the photos. The luxury flagship comes with everything from a footrest to massaging rear seats to a germ-busting UV light for your phone in the rear-seat armrest.

Getting specs out of the way first, at 207.7 inches long, the new G90 is nearly 2 inches longer than the outgoing model and has a wheelbase that's almost an inch longer. The long-wheelbase model, which unfortunately will not be coming to the US, increases the wheelbase by 7.5 inches. The only engine option is Genesis' twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission, with rear-wheel drive standard and all-wheel drive as an option. The LWB G90 gets a 48-volt electric supercharger added on, though we don't have power figures yet.

Enlarge Image Genesis

There are a bunch of new chassis features that should make the G90 even better to drive, too. The multichamber adjustable air suspension can automatically raise the front wheels when going down a slope or raise the whole car by nearly an inch for better clearance over rough surfaces. The suspension also has a camera at the front that scans the road ahead and adjusts the dampers for coming situations. A first for the G90 is rear-wheel steering that can turn up to 4 degrees in counter-phase or 2 degrees in-phase, improving low-speed maneuverability and high-speed stability. There are three different braking settings, including a chauffeur mode.

Enlarge Image Genesis

Like the exterior design, the new G90's cabin is stunning, luxurious and more than a little quirky. The dashboard has a horizontal motif that echoes Genesis' other models, with slim air vents that span the length of the dash and lovely real wood trim pieces that flow from the dash onto the door panels. The G90's gauge cluster and 12.3-inch infotainment screens are under one large glass panel that's integrated behind a winglike shape, and it's running Genesis' new infotainment system. There are a handful of physical media and climate controls in an oval-shaped section lower in the dash that also houses more digital climate controls, while the center console has the rotary gear selector and infotainment knob from the GV70 and controls for things like drive mode, audio and the seats. I love the two-spoke steering wheel, too.

Genesis describes the G90's interior as satisfying to both drivers and passengers who are being chauffeured, and to that end, the rear seat is sumptuous. As standard, the G90 has a five-seat configuration with a rear bench, but a four-seat VIP configuration is available. The VIP setup adds a fixed center console with tons of storage and an armrest that has an integrated screen and infotainment controller. But even the normal setup has a fold-down armrest with an 8-inch touchscreen, infotainment knob and controls for things like the seats and window shades. The LWB model also gets a 10.2-inch screen on each rear seat back. One additional neat feature is storage for magazines and books in the C-pillar trim.

The G90 will be offered in 12 different paint colors, including a couple of matte finishes and interesting shades like Bariloche Brown, Valencia Gold and Hallasan Green. 19-inch wheels are standard but a few different 20-inchers are optional. There are a number of interior schemes, my favorite being the two-tone Urban Brown and Glacier White. Each of the five options is available in Signature Design form, which adds leather to more surfaces along with gorgeous stitching on the seats. Some of the wood trim options are made from reprocessed newspaper, while others use the Korean sanggam technique to add Genesis' G-Matrix motif as real metal inlays. Genesis says the G90's interior uses antibacterial materials in addition to the sterilizing UV light, and the HVAC system has special air filters.

Available features include powered doors that are closable via multiple buttons inside, dual panoramic sunroofs, 22-way front seats with massage, 16-way rear seats with leg rests and neck pillows, a wireless charger for the rear seat, a foot massager for the rear seat behind the front passenger, fingerprint authentication, a head-up display, remote smart park and an integrated dash cam that's accessible via a live feed on a smartphone. The 23-speaker Bang & Olufsen sound system has a wild ""virtual venue"" 3D surround mode that imitates different sound spaces, and the G90 has laminated glass and active noise canceling. The G90 also debuts Genesis' first in-car fragrance system, and a ""mood curator"" function adjusts the fragrance, ambient lighting, seats, audio system and other features to suit different moods.

Genesis says US-spec deliveries starting at some point later this year, but pricing and fuel economy figures remain unreleased. The outgoing 2022 G90 starts at around $75,000, and given all of the new features, it wouldn't be surprising to see this new model command even more dollars."

Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian troops had landed in the southern port city of Odessa and were crossing from Russia into Kharkiv. Footage captured by security cameras showed Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine from Crimea, the peninsula that Russia seized in 2014.

Rocket attacks targeted Ukrainian fighter jets parked at an airport outside Kyiv, and Ukraine closed its airspace to commercial flights, citing the “potential hazard to civilian aviation.”"

KYIV, Ukraine — At 4:30 a.m. on Thursday, Ihor Poshyvailo, the director of the Museum of Freedom here, was woken by the sound of explosions.

He rushed outside to the street and saw airplanes flying overhead, he said. An hour later, he was in a meeting with officials from Ukraine’s Ministry of Culture trying to work out how the country’s museums could protect their collections.

“We had plans for what to do prewar,” Poshyvailo said, “but now it is a war, it’s totally different.”

By the time they considered evacuating the museum’s most prized objects from Kyiv, the roads were already clogged with Ukrainians fleeing west, and they realized it would not be possible, Poshyvailo said.

Although talk of conflict in Ukraine has been building for weeks, some of the country’s museums were badly prepared when shelling and rocket attacks began and Russian troops entered the country Thursday morning. Even if museums and other cultural sites are unlikely to be direct targets of Russian aggression, administrators worry about the security of their collections if fighting escalates and enters urban areas. Some were concerned that Russian nationalists could attack institutions that put forward Ukrainian historical and cultural narratives.

Ukraine is home to thousands of museums, ranging from small, private institutions to major state-owned collections in Kyiv, the capital, and Odessa, a port city on the Black Sea. The state collections include significant works of Ukrainian and Russian art; classical and Byzantine artifacts; and paintings by Bellini, Goya, Rubens and Jacques-Louis David.

The Museum of Freedom, which was founded in 2014, features a collection of around 4,000 objects associated with Ukraine’s pro-democracy struggles, including banners and artworks. Poshyvailo said he feared for some items if Russian troops entered Kyiv before the objects had been moved to safety.

“Our museum is evidence of Ukraine’s fight for freedom,” he said. “Of course I’m fearful.”

State museums, including the Museum of Freedom, need government permission to remove items from their buildings, a process involving a lot of paperwork. Poshyvailo said he applied to do that earlier this month, but other museums hadn’t, and the government had done nothing to make it easier for them as tensions grew in recent weeks.

Poshyvailo said he was moving items from his museum’s collection to storage, but declined to give further details.

He declined to lay blame on Ukraine’s government for a lack of preparation or guidance. “It’s not the government that has done this,” he said. “It’s Putin.”

Another Kyiv museum whose administrators feared for its collection is the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War, which also tells the story of Ukraine’s involvement in other conflicts, including its war with Russia in the country’s east starting in 2014. Yuriy Savchuk, the museum’s director, said he and his staff worked for 12 hours from 6 a.m. on Thursday to move the museum’s most important exhibits to a safe location. It was “a great feat,” he said.

The museum, which stands under Kyiv’s landmark Motherland monument, was a possible target for rocket attacks, he said.

Aleksandra Kovalchuk, the director of the Odesa Fine Arts Museum, said in a WhatsApp message that museum employees were “doing the only thing that we can” to protect its collection. That meant, she said, “hiding arts to the basement. Trying to arrange security. Barbed wire.”

The Odessa Fine Arts Museum’s collection includes more than 10,000 objects ranging from Russian and Ukrainian religious icons, dating to the 16th century and works by contemporary Ukrainian artists. Its events director, Ulyana Dovgan, said the museum was closed on Thursday. Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian troops had landed in the city.

Sergiy Lebedynsky, the director of the Museum of the Kharkiv School of Photography, in an area close to the Russian border that was shelled throughout the day, said in an email on Monday that much of his museum’s collection was in storage in Germany while the museum was being renovated. He would probably “have to evacuate the rest of our collection this week,” he said. Lebedynsky did not reply to requests to comment on Thursday.

Another museum that has removed items from the country is the War Childhood Museum, an organization based in Bosnia and Herzegovina that stages temporary shows around the world exploring children’s experiences of conflict. It had over 300 items in Kyiv that it collected after Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territory in 2014. It has presented those at temporary exhibitions in Ukraine and abroad, including a recent show in Kherson, a Russian-annexed city near Crimea.

Jasminko Halilovic, the museum’s director, said by phone that he traveled to Kyiv last week and took some 40 items needed for future exhibitions back with him to Bosnia and Herzegovina. But he said around 300 other items had remained in Kyiv, as had the organization’s three full-time staff members in the country. “They want to stay,” Halilovic said. “It’s their country. They have family and friends. And it also seems a privilege to leave, when not everyone else can.”

The situation for Ukraine’s museums was changing rapidly on Thursday, including the issue of which staff members would be on hand to look after them. That was clear during the phone interview with Poshyvailo of the Museum of Freedom. At the end of the call, Poshyvailo said he had just learned that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had called on able-bodied men under 60 to take up arms in the conflict.

Poshyvailo, 54, said he was ready to fight if needed. But first, he had to make sure his collection was safe.

Putin of Russia announced on television that he had decided “to carry out a special military operation” in Ukraine, explosions were reported across the country.

Blasts were heard in Kyiv, the capital; in Kharkiv, the second largest city; and in Kramatorsk in the region of Donetsk, one of two eastern Ukrainian territories claimed by Russia-backed separatists since 2014.

Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian troops had landed in the southern port city of Odessa and were crossing from Russia into Kharkiv. Footage captured by security cameras showed Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine from Crimea, the peninsula that Russia seized in 2014.

Rocket attacks targeted Ukrainian fighter jets parked at an airport outside Kyiv, and Ukraine closed its airspace to commercial flights, citing the “potential hazard to civilian aviation.”

More than 40 Ukrainian soldiers were killed and dozens were wounded in the fighting on Thursday morning, said Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.

As air raid sirens blared in Kyiv, the western city of Lviv and other urban areas, residents rushed to take shelter in bus and subway stations. In Kyiv, people packed up their cars and waited in long lines to fill up with gas on their way out of the city. In eastern Ukraine, early signs of panic appeared on the streets as lines formed at A.T.M.s and gas stations.

With attacks across the country, it quickly became clear that Russia’s campaign, whatever Mr. Putin meant by a “special military operation,” was aimed at far more than the rebel territories in the east. Within an hour, Ukraine’s state emergency service said that attacks had been launched in 10 regions of Ukraine, primarily in the east and south, and that reports of new shelling were “coming in constantly.”

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, called it “a full-scale invasion of Ukraine” and said his country would defend itself, while calling on the world to “stop Putin.”

Russia’s Defense Ministry said that it was using “high-precision weapons” to disable military infrastructure, air defense facilities, military airfields and Ukrainian army planes, Russia’s state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. But the ministry said it was not attacking cities, and promised that “the civilian population is not at risk.”

The Ukrainian authorities said that invading naval forces were coming ashore at multiple points, including in Kharkiv and the southern city of Kherson. Three emergency workers were injured when a command post was struck by shelling in Nizhyn, in the north, and six people were trapped under rubble when the city’s airport came under attack, Ukraine’s Interior Ministry reported.

Military depots, warehouses and National Guard were hit with artillery blasts, the ministry said.

As dawn broke in Kyiv, Mr. Zelensky of Ukraine said he had declared martial law. The country’s defense minister told citizens that the army was “fending off enemy forces” and “doing everything it can to protect you.”

But the army was under siege. In the east, Russia-backed separatists — their ranks bolstered by the arrival of hundreds of Russian mercenaries in recent days, according to European officials — said they were hammering Ukrainian troops along the entire 250-mile front line that has divided the rebels and Ukrainian forces since 2014.

Seeking to capture the entire territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, which Mr. Putin recognized as independent on Monday, the rebels were “using all weapons at their disposal,” the Russian news media reported. Ukrainian officials said the attacks included artillery strikes.

Ukraine’s state border service reported that Russian troops stationed in Belarus, north of Ukraine, had launched an attack with support from the Belarusian military. Russia had deployed as many as 30,000 troops to Belarus for exercises this month that the United States warned could provide cover for an attack against Kyiv, which lies a fast 140-mile drive away from a main border crossing. President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus denied that his forces were involved.

By midmorning in Kyiv, Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had disabled all of Ukraine’s air defenses and air bases. Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian forces had captured two villages in the Luhansk region.

The fighting intensified as Ukrainian forces shot down six Russian fighters and a helicopter in a fight to maintain control over key cities, a senior Ukrainian military official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to release information outside official channels. Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, called on all Ukrainian civilians to join the fight and enlist with territorial defense units.

“Ukraine is moving into all-out defense mode,” he said."

CORONA, Calif., Feb. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Lace up for some seriously big airs! Monster Energy is proud to welcome five-time X Games gold medalist and vertical skateboard innovator Elliot Sloan on Episode 25 of the sports and pop culture podcast UNLEASHED with The Dingo and Danny.

Released today across Monster Energy's social media channels, the new 55-minute episode features the 33-year-old Mega Ramp skateboarder who trains at his own private compound in Vista, California. Known as the world's #1 competitor in the Skateboard Big Air discipline, Sloan advanced from humble East Coast beginnings to earning a pro model skateboard from the company owned by his idol, skate icon Tony Hawk.

Remembering when Hawk and the Birdhouse team surprised him with the pro model, Sloan said on the episode: ""It was probably the best day of my life! Definitely a full circle moment. From him being the person who first got me into skateboarding and sent me on this path in life, to riding for his board company. And now having my own board on Birdhouse, that's pretty awesome!""

Fans can now listen to Sloan's rags to riches journey from unknown East Coast skate rat to boundary-pushing pro rider. Released today, the new podcast recorded at Studio M inside Monster Energy headquarters in Corona, California, is streaming on all major platforms, including Spotify, iTunes, and YouTube.

Born and raised in New York City, Sloan started skateboarding outside the industry's spotlight. After building his halfpipe skills at local parks out East, he took the gamble of moving to California with dreams of becoming a sponsored pro. And it worked: After claiming his first X Games gold in the Big Air discipline in 2013, Sloan joined the elite field of Mega Ramp innovators. Today, he owns 13 X Games medals (5 gold, 6 silver, 2 bronze) and endorses a pro model skateboard on Tony Hawk's company, Birdhouse. Training at his private compound in Vista, California, Sloan continues pushing the boundaries of vertical skateboarding and living the dream.

Story continues

Where does Sloan get the inspiration for never-been-done tricks and how does he cope with the risks connected to Mega Ramp skateboarding? Tune in now! The innovator shares his creative process with the two UNLEASHED podcast hosts, Australian action sports personality Luke ""The Dingo"" Trembath and professional snowboarder Danny Kass.

Growing up in Manhattan, Sloan started out doing what all the other urban kids did back then. ""I used to skate street and mess around. I feel lucky growing up there. The Nineties in the city were pretty iconic!"" But one day, he tuned into ESPN and his entire world changed. ""Then I saw Tony Hawk do the 900 at the X Games in 1999. That was it for me! I was like, 'I'm going to the skatepark tomorrow and skate vert!'""

Fortunately, two of the public skateparks around town featured halfpipes at the time. Sloan became a local at Chelsea Piers and the 108th Street skatepark in Riverside. As his skills gradually progressed, he expanded his radius to ride what few vert ramps existed on the East Coast, heading all the way to Philadelphia to pursue his passion. But ultimately, the harsh winters and lack of year-round facilities held back his progress. Scratching ice off his car's windshield one day, Sloan made a resolution: Move to California, the focus of vertical skateboarding at the time, without a plan but dreams of becoming a pro skater.

After driving cross-country in his van, Sloan settled in Cali working odd jobs and trying to break into competitive vert skateboarding. Instant reality check! ""I worked jobs and entered a few Dew Tours trying to qualify. But I always ended up dead last,"" said Sloan on UNLEASHED.

Ultimately, his persistence paid off. Sloan became a ramp local at the training facility designed by Bob Burnquist, the most decorated skateboarder in X Games history. As it happened, the facility included a Mega Ramp featuring a giant roll-in into a 60-feet gap jump and a 27-foot quarter pipe. Originally pioneered by pro skateboarder Danny Way, Mega Ramps are considered the burliest obstacles in the skate universe. And although featured as an official X Games event since 2004, 'Mega' is reserved for a handful of select riders.

""It took me a couple of months to build up the courage to ride that thing,"" said Sloan, who suddenly found himself riding with the sport's elite on a daily basis. ""It was a very small group of dudes riding Mega at the time. I skated alongside Jake [Brown], Danny [Way], Bob [Burnquist] and Rob Lorifice.""

As it turned out, Sloan found his niche riding Mega. Not afraid to pay the price for riding at this risk level – he details some of the scariest falls on UNLEASHED – he climbed the ranks of Big Air Skateboarding. Until 2013 proved his breakout year: Starting with silver at X Games Foz do Iguacu 2013, Sloan earned a podium spot in every single Big Air event that season, culminating in his first gold medal at X Games Los Angeles. Since then, he's emerged as a dominant force and took his fourth gold in the discipline at the most recent Big Air event at X Games Minneapolis 2019.

Today, Sloan trains at his residence in Vista, where he built his own Mega Ramp compound. ""I got pretty lucky with the neighbors. And I got lucky with the property, because in the city that it's in, you don't need permits for anything under 30 feet tall,"" said Sloan about the facility featured in viral videos that generate more than 100,000 views on YouTube.

Asked about new tricks innovations, Sloan revealed on the podcast: ""I'm inspired by everything. There's a couple snowboard tricks I still want to figure out how to do on a skateboard."" Looking back, he names the inventor of the Mega Ramp in 2003 as a main driver: ""Originally it was Danny Way. Seeing the DC Video was my all-time inspiration. I was 11 or 12 and they just got the video at the skate shop. They popped it in… and that was it!""

While the future of competitive Mega Ramp riding remains uncertain (the next X Games contest remains to be announced), Sloan has returned to 'traditional' halfpipe riding. After taking double silver at X Games 2021 (Vert & Best Trick), he will be dropping into the Skateboard Vert competition at X Games Chiba in Japan this April. Plus, Sloan currently has a new Mega Ramp record attempt in mind, as first revealed on the episode!

Globally, the automotive future is looking increasingly electric, due to growing regulatory moves, including forthcoming bans on sales of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, shifting consumer behavior, and ongoing improvements in battery and charging technology. By 2035, the world’s major automotive markets—the United States, European Union, and China—are expected to sell only electric vehicles (EVs), and by 2050, 80 percent of the world’s vehicle sales are expected to be electric. EVs are a critical component of achieving climate neutrality (in Europe, for example, the life-cycle emissions of an EV are around 65 to 85 percent lower than that of an ICE vehicle) and improving quality of life in cities by reducing air and noise pollution.

This article seeks to answer two questions: How will the trend toward electric mobility play out in sub-Saharan Africa? What are the opportunities and challenges associated with the region’s electric transport future?

Sidebar Common EV terminology EVs typically refer to BEVs (battery electric vehicles) unless otherwise specified. Range anxiety is the concern that a battery may lose charge while on the road without access to charging infrastructure. Parc refers to the total stock of vehicles on the road. EV adoption rate is the share of electric vehicles purchased in a year. Vehicle charging is divided into three levels: Level 1 charging uses a standard home power outlet and typically provides 5 to 8 kilometers (km) per hour of charging.

Level 2 charging requires specialized equipment, costing between $200 to $1,000, that can be installed at home, at the workplace, or in public locations and can charge 20 to 130 km per hour (depending on the equipment).

Level 3 (or DC fast charging) uses direct current (DC), costs tens of thousands of dollars per charger to install, and can charge 5 to 30 km per minute. This type of charger is typically for high-use commercial vehicles like buses or for highway driving where fast charging is required midoperation. Vans (or light commercial vehicles) are less than 3.5 tons, including panel vans, utility vans, and pickups.

Transport currently makes up 10 percent of Africa’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which is expected to increase in line with sub-Saharan Africa’s expanding vehicle parc (Exhibit 1). In the six countries that make up around 70 percent of sub-Saharan Africa’s annual vehicle sales and 45 percent of the region’s population (South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Nigeria), the vehicle parc is expected to grow from 25 million vehicles today to an estimated 58 million by 2040, driven by urbanization and rising incomes. As its vehicle parc grows, the challenge for sub-Saharan Africa will be to push for more sustainable mobility and avoid the risk of becoming the dumping ground for the world’s unwanted used ICE vehicles.

Some governments in sub-Saharan Africa have started to announce electrification targets for vehicles and incentives for EV adoption—such as Rwanda’s announced tax exemptions for EV sales. Moreover, a growing start-up ecosystem for EVs, focusing particularly on electric two-wheelers, is emerging in the region. McKinsey estimates that as of the end of 2021, there were more than 20 start-ups in the ecosystem, which combined raised over $25 million in funding that year.

While momentum is building, sub-Saharan Africa faces some unique challenges in its electric mobility transition, including, in some cases, unreliable electricity supply, low vehicle affordability, and the dominance of used vehicles. Many countries have made significant strides toward improving electricity access (all six countries mentioned have urban-electricity-access rates above 70 percent and some more than 90 percent); however, electricity reliability remains an issue. A 2019 survey across 34 African countries found that fewer than half of those connected to the grid have reliable electricity. In addition, the reported 2020 System Average Interruption Disruption Index (SAIDI) for sub-Saharan Africa was 39.30 versus 0.87 for OECD high-income countries.

The second challenge is affordability, shaped by comparatively low household incomes, low availability of asset finance at affordable rates, and higher price points for EVs.

The third issue is the dominance of used vehicles on much of the continent (excluding a few countries such as South Africa, where used-vehicle imports are banned). In most sub-Saharan African countries, around 85 percent of all four-wheel vehicle sales are used vehicles. This is driven by affordability challenges and weak regulation, with many countries allowing the import of vehicles over 15 years’ old and with fairly low emissions standards. A 2020 United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report states that 40 out of 49 sub-Saharan Africa countries have weak or very weak used-vehicle regulations. New EVs will therefore struggle to compete with old, low-cost ICE vehicles that are readily available in the region. And, given that 40 percent of all globally exported used vehicles end up in Africa, the continent runs the risk of becoming a dumping ground for used ICE vehicles while the rest of the world transitions to an electric transport future.

In this article, we look at some of the challenges and opportunities associated with sub-Saharan Africa’s electric transport journey, including some of the steps governments, development partners, and private-sector stakeholders can consider taking to build an enabling ecosystem for EVs in the region.

Opportunities and challenges to EV adoption in sub-Saharan Africa

Sidebar Large buses and trucks This McKinsey analysis focuses on smaller vehicle classes. The technology and ecosystem for the electrification of large, long-haul trucks are still being developed globally and are unlikely to scale to sub-Saharan Africa in the next 20 years. Large buses have a case for electrification, with China and the European Union both setting targets for their adoption (electric buses are already widespread in many Chinese cities). However, as most large buses in sub-Saharan Africa are currently used for intercity transportation, often driving well above 100 km a day, they are, for now, unlikely candidates for electrification. Minibuses remain the dominant form of urban public transportation. However, governments in sub-Saharan Africa are increasingly encouraging the use of large buses for urban public transport, which could impact the electrification potential and charging infrastructure required. For example, Kenya has stated that it will be encouraging the use of electric buses as part of the Nairobi Bus Rapid Transit system.

In assessing the opportunity for EV adoption in sub-Saharan Africa, we engaged more than 70 organizations, including local EV start-ups, vehicle assemblers and distributors, electricity-distribution companies, commercial fleet owners, minibus associations, regulators, and financiers, and surveyed nearly 1,000 vehicle owners in major markets. This article focuses primarily on two-wheelers, passenger cars, minibuses (14-seater vans, currently the predominant form of public transport in sub-Saharan Africa), and light commercial vehicles (vans), which together comprise most of the vehicle parc in sub-Saharan Africa (see sidebar “Large buses and trucks”). South Africa is not included in this analysis due to some key differences compared with the rest of the region, including its ban on used-vehicle imports, higher consumer income, and relatively small two-wheeler parc (less than 3 percent of the total vehicle parc, versus up to 50 percent in most other sub-Saharan African countries). However, many of the findings are likely still applicable in the overall South African context.

This article’s findings indicate high awareness of EVs among drivers, a favorable total cost of ownership for EVs, and a growing use case for electric two-wheelers in particular, though up-front costs may stall the widespread uptake of EVs.

Awareness of EVs is high among passenger-car owners. Over 90 percent of all vehicle owners surveyed in Nigeria and Kenya had heard of EVs, with most recognizing that the technology is sound and better for the environment. However, almost all stated “range anxiety” (see sidebar “Common EV terminology”) and high up-front costs as their primary concerns.

The total cost of ownership is favorable, but up-front costs are currently prohibitive. The total cost of ownership (TCO) of EVs is more favorable than that of ICE vehicles, even in countries with fairly high electricity costs like Kenya, where the residential electricity tariff is over 20 cents per kilowatt-hour (Exhibit 2). These economics improve the more a vehicle is driven due to the lower operating costs, meaning that vehicles used for commercial purposes (such as minibuses, vans, and two-wheelers) are more favorable for early transition. Despite high awareness of EVs, few individuals we surveyed understood the benefits, with some commercial fleet owners and bus associations expressing surprise at the favorable lifetime economics of EVs.

Exhibit 2 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com

Nonetheless, up-front costs remain a barrier. While Exhibit 2 shows the projected comparison for a used ICE vehicle and electric car in 2030, the availability of EVs is currently limited to new vehicles, whereas most vehicles purchased in sub-Saharan Africa are low-cost used ICE vehicles. Surveyed passenger-car owners in Kenya and Nigeria estimate they spend between $6,000 and $10,000 to purchase a used ICE vehicle. Until used four-wheeler EVs become available at scale at similar prices—likely in the mid to late 2030s, it is unlikely they will be able to compete without incentives. In sub-Saharan Africa, this also impacts some commercial vehicle classes, such as vans, as these are often purchased used and owned by individuals or private associations who then hire them out. In Kenya, for example, nearly 50 percent of all vans are likely owned by individuals on a for-hire basis, which means that the ability to purchase an EV still relies on the owner’s income and access to affordable financing.

Driving behavior in Africa is suitable for EV adoption, with some exceptions. Understanding driving and parking behavior is critical to assessing the region’s potential for EV adoption. Vehicle owners who tend to drive less than 100 kilometers (km) per day and park in a dedicated space at home or at work can typically use basic Level 1 or Level 2 EV charging (see sidebar “Common EV terminology”). Most personal car owners in sub-Saharan Africa fit these criteria, even when factoring in time spent in traffic, as EVs are very efficient in start-stop conditions.

The picture becomes more complex, however, for taxis, minibuses, and vans that are in frequent use and travel long distances every day. Vehicles that travel more than 100 km a day with limited stops would require fairly high-cost Level 3 DC fast-charging infrastructure along major routes or at commercial centers. Short routes for minibuses and vans that park overnight at a fixed station may be more suitable for early EV adoption, where a wall charger can be installed with comparatively limited investment.

Emerging use case for electric two-wheeler adoption. Unlike all other vehicle segments assessed, two-wheelers (called boda bodas in much of East Africa and okadas in Nigeria) are predominantly purchased new in sub-Saharan Africa. More than nine in ten two-wheelers are purchased for commercial use as taxis or delivery services. Commercial use results in a higher average distance traveled per vehicle, which improves the TCO of the electric two-wheeler versus the ICE two-wheeler. This also results in a fairly high fleet turnover, with an urban owner in Kenya and Nigeria purchasing a new two-wheeler every two to three years, on average. And because electric two-wheelers have a small battery, they can be charged via a mini-grid, making them suitable for use in locations with low access to reliable electricity-grid infrastructure. They can also benefit from a battery-swap model, in which a depleted battery is replaced with a fully charged battery from a designated “swap station” in just a few minutes.

These factors strengthen the case for more widespread adoption of electric two-wheelers in sub-Saharan Africa, following the trend seen in Asia. A number of start-ups are already investing in the region’s nascent electric two-wheeler space to design vehicles at a cost and durability suitable for the local market. For example, Opibus in Kenya is investing in local R&D and assembly to build an electric motorcycle tailored to the needs of boda boda drivers who demand a high-durability vehicle that can go up to 130 km per day at a comparable cost to an ICE two-wheeler. Companies such as Ampersand in Rwanda are also developing a network of battery-swapping stations to enable two-wheeler drivers to exchange depleted batteries for fully charged batteries on the go.

Even with this emerging use case, there are still challenges to overcome. Issues include the higher up-front price point for electric two-wheelers versus ICE two-wheelers (estimated at $1,700 to $1,800 in mid-2021 versus $1,300 in Kenya), unknown battery lifetime data given that motorcycles in sub-Saharan Africa go much longer daily distances than those in Asia, and the high cost of battery swapping.

Despite these challenges, the TCO for electric two-wheelers is favorable. Even with a higher up-front cost—and assuming no residual value—the electric two-wheeler is 25 percent cheaper over a five-year life cycle compared with an ICE two-wheeler due to fuel and maintenance savings. Moreover, initial driver feedback on electric two-wheelers in sub-Saharan Africa has been very positive. A recent pilot by the UK Aid–funded Manufacturing Africa program involving a side-by-side test of 20 drivers using electric two-wheelers and 20 drivers using ICE two-wheelers found that more than 90 percent of the electric two-wheeler drivers felt they performed as well, if not better, than the ICE two-wheeler. All of the participating drivers indicated that they are likely or very likely to purchase an electric two-wheeler as their next vehicle. This combination of local companies investing to solve the challenges to adoption and positive consumer perception suggests high potential for electric two-wheelers in the region.

Mixed potential for electric vehicles in sub-Saharan Africa

Based on these findings, McKinsey mapped different vehicle segments across a number of criteria to determine their feasibility for EV adoption in sub-Saharan Africa (Exhibit 3). This mapping is based on the situation today; as more used EVs become available post-2030 and technologies evolve, this assessment may evolve too. Exhibit 3 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com

Using this analysis, two potential scenarios emerge for EV adoption in sub-Saharan Africa:

Base-case scenario, primarily driven by as-is market conditions. Under this scenario, regulatory intervention to encourage the EV transition is limited; adoption is driven by EV affordability and availability. Vehicle segments that are dominated by used vehicles do not transition at any significant level until after 2035, when used EVs start to become available at sufficient scale to compete with used ICE vehicles in terms of affordability. Corporate-owned fleets (estimated at around half of all vans) are expected to switch to EVs faster, driven by companies’ sustainability commitments and the benefits of EV’s lower operating costs. Given the existing momentum in the electric two-wheeler segment, this segment is expected to grow dramatically, in line with the trend in Asia, given favorable TCO and high fleet turnover. This scenario also factors in the current electricity reliability issues in each country (for example, in Nigeria, low reliability means lower adoption rates) but assumes that investments will continue to improve reliability over time.

Accelerated case scenario, with EV market actively shaped by stakeholders. Under this scenario, multiple interventions lead to accelerated adoption. For example, governments put in place regulations and incentives to encourage adoption, such as those seen in other countries, including ICE vehicle sales bans and tax exemptions for EVs. This accelerates adoption across all vehicle segments but could have greater impact on minibus and van segments in particular, where owners are more “TCO conscious” and also potentially more likely to face targeted incentives or regulations, such as mandates for all public transport to be electric within a certain timeframe. This is the case in countries such as Norway, where 75 percent of long-distance buses must be zero-emission by 2030. This scenario assumes government or private actors invest significantly in the electricity system, improving overall electricity reliability and installing fast-charging infrastructure for taxis, minibuses, and vans.

In both scenarios, this analysis indicates that two-wheelers will electrify fastest, with electric two-wheeler sales rising to 50 to 70 percent of all sales by 2040 (Exhibit 4). In Kenya and Nigeria alone—two of the largest two-wheeler markets in sub-Saharan Africa—this would translate into three million to four million electric two-wheeler sales per year by 2040.

Exhibit 4 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com

Vans and minibuses would likely electrify next, but they have greater variability in the base and accelerated cases due to the potential of targeted regulation, with approximately 20 percent and 25 percent sales adoption by 2040 in the base case, respectively, and around 35 percent and 45 percent in the accelerated case.

Electrification of passenger cars would likely be slowest, due to the expected supply constraints of used EVs in Africa before 2030. In the base case, around one in five passenger cars will be electric by 2040, and in the accelerated case, nearly one in three, based on stricter import regulation on used cars or incentives for EV adoption such as tax exemptions. This equates to a roughly ten-year “lag” behind the expected adoption trend in the European Union.

In aggregate, across all vehicle segments, these scenarios could result in a 20 to 25 percent annual carbon emissions reduction in 2040, assuming the current electricity-generation mix.

The curves in Exhibit 4 represent an average across five countries that make up 60 percent of all vehicle sales in sub-Saharan Africa, excluding South Africa. Some countries, such as Rwanda and Kenya, are expected to transition faster, with EVs accounting for 60 to 75 percent of all two-wheeler sales by 2040. This is due to a range of factors, such as stronger regulation on the age of used-vehicle imports in Kenya, incentives for EV adoption in Rwanda, comparatively better electricity reliability in both countries, and the growing presence of EV start-ups.

Sidebar Alternative fuels Some countries and private companies in sub-Saharan Africa are exploring “cleaner” fossil fuels as a stepping-stone to lowering carbon emissions from transport, including liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), also called autogas or compressed natural gas (CNG). Both fuels can drive a 10 to 15 percent reduction in tailpipe carbon emissions compared with petrol. This is compared with at least 40 percent reduction (and up to 100 percent) for EVs, even in countries with a high use of fossil fuels in electricity generation. LPG and CNG should thus be viewed only as transition fuels on the journey to zero-emission transport. Conversion to autogas requires a comparatively low-cost upgrade to an existing petrol engine, at a cost that can be recovered in less than one year for commercial vehicles traveling long distances. Many countries are already making investments in LPG terminal and distribution infrastructure to support its use as a clean cooking fuel. This infrastructure could be cross-leveraged to support autogas for transport as an intermediate step for some vehicle segments. In particular, conversion to autogas can be relatively low cost for commercial vehicles like taxis, heavy vehicles like large buses, and even large long-haul trucks—segments that will require significant infrastructure investment to support electrification due to their high daily mileage. CNG, on the other hand, has a weaker investment case. Unlike LPG, its primary use would be for road transport. This would require building dedicated high-cost infrastructure (including port and inland terminals, bulk storage, and distribution and retail networks) for a fuel that is at best a stepping-stone toward cleaner transport at a time when the global trend is toward electrification, with ICE vehicles being phased out by many manufacturers. The investment might be better directed toward strengthening and decarbonizing the electricity grid and making EV charging more accessible. Another fuel option is hydrogen, which can have zero to minimal carbon emissions if using green or blue production methods. However, according to the Hydrogen Council, the costs of hydrogen production currently make it economically viable only for heavier road-transportation applications such as large trucks.

EVs are an evolving technology, and this analysis makes several assumptions on unknown factors, including competition with alternative fuels (see sidebar “Alternative fuels”). One critical unknown is how long batteries will last and whether they will be suitable for the 300,000 km lifetime mileage often seen in Africa. Two test cases of the Tesla Model S and Nissan Leaf have shown these vehicles going over 150,000 km with at least 80 percent of the original battery capacity retained. Based on these results and the ongoing investments in battery technology, this analysis assumes that batteries will indeed last for many miles. We further assume that used EVs will follow similar depreciation curves and export trends as seen for ICE vehicles. For example, countries will not seek to retain used EVs in their home markets to recycle batteries, as the value of an exported EV is higher than that of a recycled battery, meaning it makes more economic sense to export the used EV.

Due to the challenges mentioned, sub-Saharan Africa’s EV adoption curves are still slower than those expected globally. For example, by 2040 90 percent of all two-wheeler sales are expected to be electric, driven by growing demand in India, China, and Southeast Asia, as are nearly 70 percent of all car sales. Nonetheless, even if the adoption rates are lower, the difference between the base case and accelerated case is significant in sub-Saharan countries, with the accelerated case translating to more than double the number of EVs on the road by 2030 and 30 percent more by 2040.

Building an enabling ecosystem

Governments, development partners, and private stakeholders can consider working together to build the ecosystem required to help EVs scale in sub-Saharan Africa and push toward the accelerated growth case.

Four primary categories of enablers could be considered:

scaling electricity and charging infrastructure

innovating local production and supply chains

considering regulatory mechanisms

financing assets, assemblers, and infrastructure

Scaling electricity and charging infrastructure

Stable electricity supply and charging infrastructure will need to be built ahead of demand to mitigate the range anxiety that may hinder consumers from adopting EVs.

Electricity system developers and operators will need to plan ahead to build the infrastructure for EVs. This includes improving electricity access and reliability, while also planning for increased domestic consumption at off-peak times, since vehicles are likely to be charging overnight. In the case of electric two-wheelers, charging is also possible via mini-grids, making these vehicles a core solution in areas with poor grid access or reliability.

Companies can also proactively invest in charging infrastructure, including partnerships with large retail actors to set up public charging stations. For example, many minibuses in Kenya park overnight at petrol stations so setting up charging in these locations could enable an electric transition for minibuses. Partnerships with shared-mobility providers could also help with charging-network optimization. This is being seen in Asia, where Gojek (a ride-hailing company) and Gogoro (an electric two-wheeler company) are partnering in Indonesia to set up battery- swapping stations in high-use locations.

In addition to charging, electric two-wheelers will likely need to be supported by a network of battery-swapping stations, as the long daily distances traveled by many commercial two-wheelers mean they might need to swap “on the go.” The creation of a common battery standard would significantly help in the development of the sector, as it would allow for the creation of a common battery-swapping “utility” that would bring down the amount of battery inventory required for each company. This initiative is already being pursued globally through the swappable battery consortium formed in 2021 by Piaggio, KTM, Honda, and Yamaha.

Innovating local production and supply chains

EV companies could consider investing in homegrown-product innovation to design or tailor EVs for local needs and conditions. As mentioned, two-wheelers in sub-Saharan Africa tend to travel much longer daily distances compared with those in Asia (up to 130 km in Kenya versus an estimated 40 to 50 km in Asia). Developing an electric two-wheeler that is both durable and capable of carrying a spare battery may be required to meet the needs of the sub-Saharan African two-wheeler driver. Stakeholders can also invest in retrofitting existing ICE vehicles with electric powertrains. This would likely be the most economically feasible alternative for larger vehicles that go long distances, such as vans or minibuses, as the lifetime cost trade-off of an electric versus an ICE powertrain is favorable over a shorter timeframe.

Local vehicle assemblers may also invest in national and regional supply chains by manufacturing some parts locally. Going even further upstream, and as discussed in McKinsey’s Green Africa report, sub-Saharan Africa has many of the raw materials needed to develop a supply chain for at least the attractive cathode segment of batteries used in EVs.

Considering regulatory mechanisms

As seen in other countries, regulatory mechanisms can be a significant driver for EV adoption. Globally, countries have adopted a range of approaches, including hard targets such as banning sales of ICE vehicles within certain timeframes or setting emissions standards or fiscal incentives such as tax exemptions for EV sales or subsidies for charging infrastructure. These can also include soft incentives such as reduced registration times for EVs or allowing free parking for EV drivers (Exhibit 5).

Financing assets, assemblers, and infrastructure

Four broad types of financing would help to accelerate the transition, including asset financing, financing for EV importers and assemblers, financing for charging infrastructure (for example, battery-swapping stations for electric two-wheelers, installation of Level 1 and Level 2 public charging points), and infrastructure financing for electricity grid and mini-grid development. This will require some innovation in financing models, including credit guarantees to derisk lending. Take asset financing, for example. Formal asset financing is an established model in some countries, such as Kenya, where an estimated 90 percent of two-wheelers are financed through specialized players. Other countries rely on more informal models, such as Nigeria, where around 30 percent of two-wheelers are financed via okada associations and the remainder through informal borrowing from friends and family. The unknown depreciation curves and technology life cycles of EVs mean that asset financiers might be reluctant to finance them. Derisking models such as credit guarantees might be required to encourage asset financing for EVs. For vehicles such as vans or minibuses, lease-to-own models for retrofitted electric powertrains could also be explored.

Innovative financing models, such as carbon credits for charging infrastructure, are already being launched globally. The world’s first validated and registered carbon offset program for EV chargers, with plans to finance 3,500 fast-chargers in the United States, was announced in 2020 by SCS Global Services, Electrify America, and Verra.

Sub-Saharan Africa faces many unique challenges in the electrification of transport, but it is critical that the continent is not left behind as the rest of the world transitions. Failure to create an enabling ecosystem for electric transport could see the region becoming a dumping ground for old ICE vehicles, setting back the continent’s carbon-emission-reduction goals as the vehicle parc continues to grow in the decades ahead.

The automotive future may be electric, but in sub-Saharan Africa, private-sector stakeholders, development partners, and governments may need to consider collaborative measures to accelerate the EV transition, or Africa may find itself stuck in the slow lane."

In the long, repetitive history of humans dreaming of faster ways to move people between places, pneumatic tubes—the type of system used to move interoffice mail either with pressurized air or a partial vacuum effect—has been an idea whose time has come at least five different times. They come in bursts of imagination followed by some experimentation and, ultimately, disappointment, which is then forgotten during long periods of silence.

We are living through the fifth era of pneumatic tube transportation dreams, which are generally referred to these days as Hyperloops. This era kicked off in 2013 when Elon Musk published what is reverentially referred to in the Hyperloop world as The Alpha Paper. Characteristically, the Alpha Paper makes no mention of any of the previous four eras. but it did spark several startups to take up Musk’s challenge and build a Hyperloop itself, which Musk uncharacteristically declined to do.

One of those startups was called Hyperloop One, co-founded by a former SpaceX engineer named Brogan BamBrogan, who left in 2016 under bizarre circumstances involving a noose and an attempted restraining order. (BamBrogan then founded another company called Arrivo that promised to be “the end of traffic” using a sled-based system for moving cars along tracks; it shut down at the end of 2018.) The following year, Hyperloop One was rebranded as Virgin Hyperloop One after receiving an investment by Richard Branson.

Advertisement

But after some five more years of work towards finally achieving a 200-year-old dream to move people through tubes at near-supersonic speeds, Virgin Hyperloop One has laid off half its staff to focus on moving cargo instead of people, an entirely predictable outcome if anyone involved had bothered to read up on the history of pneumatic tube transportation. It is a longer history than one might expect, but one with the steady drumbeat of failure.

The idea for improving travel speeds by reducing air resistance in a controlled tube setting was first proposed by various figures in the early 19th Century. The most prominent example was in 1812 when George Medhurst in London published his catchily-named paper, “Calculations and Remarks, Tending to Prove the Practicability, Effects and Advantages of A Plan for the Rapid Conveyance of Goods and Passengers Upon An Iron Road Through a Tube of 30 Feet in Area, By the Power and Velocity of Air.”

Thirty years later, something resembling a pneumatic tube transit boom occurred, or as they were called at the time, “atmospheric railways.” The Dalkey Atmospheric Railway in Dublin operated between 1844 and 1854 at a top speed of 40 mph—not much faster, if at all, than regular trains of the era—on a track a little less than two miles long, running small carriages every half hour. Two more ambitious projects in London and Devon, England around the same time were abandoned due to insurmountable technical difficulties and cost overruns. There were other experiments and tests around this time, most notably the Beach Pneumatic Transit line, a 300-foot tube constructed in secret under Broadway in Manhattan, which shut down amid investor skepticism and one of the many financial panics of the late 19th Century made funding an expansion a non-starter.

Advertisement

Still, the idea of moving people through airless tubes was just close enough that a new generation of dreamers revived the idea. In the early 20th Century, college student Robert Goddard published a short story that imagined trains moving through vacuum tubes, or VacTrains. Scientist Emile Batchelet had been thinking about something similar. So had Russian professor Boris Weinberg. None of these dreams resulted in any practical experimentation.

The fourth era began in the postwar period when people were ready to dream big things again. In 1969, a contractor named Lawrence Edwards who worked on a feasibility study conducted by Lockheed and the Department of Defense on Vactrains founded Transit Tube Corporation and pitched a plan for an “urban gravity-vacuum transit system” in the Bay Area. Robert Salter of the RAND Corporation also published a series of articles promoting a similar concept. Around the same time, a group of European inventors founded Swissmetro, a Transit Tube Corporation counterpart. It all went nowhere.

Advertisement

There is something different about this fifth era, something that feels more like the second one in the mid-to-late 19th Century, when railroads and other well-capitalized entrepreneurs were actually trying out this idea, two periods in modern human history with rampant wealth inequality and modern industry creating mega-corporations with more money than they know what to do with (Virgin Hyperloop One’s largest investor is DP World, a massively profitable port logistics firm based in Dubai).

It’s not so much that this fifth era has already failed, but rather the promises were so grandiose it could not have possibly succeeded: A network of tubes connecting cities hundreds of miles apart in a matter of minutes, seamlessly interweaving pods merging and diverging traveling at faster-than-airplane speeds in perfect safety, emitting virtually zero carbon.

But a feasibility study conducted by HyperloopTT, the last major Hyperloop organization trying to make passenger travel a reality, exposes some starker realities. Activating the emergency brakes would take four to five miles. Headways will not be the seconds previously advertised, but more like every six to ten minutes during peak hours, every half hour otherwise, in pods that carry a dozen or two passengers each, meaning promised passenger loads of thousands of people per hour would prove fundamentally impossible to achieve. And far from being a direct trip no matter where one is going, the pods would make intermediate stops, just like trains do.

These are not technological limitations. They are limitations that stem from basic rules about time and space, ones that do not change from century to century. Nevertheless, HyperloopTT will carry on. “We remain committed to building a sustainable adaptable system that includes both passenger and cargo,” Andres De Leon, CEO of HyperloopTT, said in a statement to Motherboard. “Interest in hyperloop around the world is stronger than ever. We expect 2022 to be a year of continued progress and growth for HyperloopTT.”"

Putin of Russia announced on television that he had decided “to carry out a special military operation” in Ukraine, explosions were reported across the country.

Blasts were heard in Kyiv, the capital; in Kharkiv, the second largest city; and in Kramatorsk in the region of Donetsk, one of two eastern Ukrainian territories claimed by Russia-backed separatists since 2014.

Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian troops had landed in the southern port city of Odessa and were crossing from Russia into Kharkiv. Footage captured by security cameras showed Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine from Crimea, the peninsula that Russia seized in 2014.

Rocket attacks targeted Ukrainian fighter jets parked at an airport outside Kyiv, and Ukraine closed its airspace to commercial flights, citing the “potential hazard to civilian aviation.”

More than 40 Ukrainian soldiers were killed and dozens were wounded in the fighting on Thursday morning, said Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.

As air raid sirens blared in Kyiv, the western city of Lviv and other urban areas, residents rushed to take shelter in bus and subway stations. In Kyiv, people packed up their cars and waited in long lines to fill up with gas on their way out of the city. In eastern Ukraine, early signs of panic appeared on the streets as lines formed at A.T.M.s and gas stations.

With attacks across the country, it quickly became clear that Russia’s campaign, whatever Mr. Putin meant by a “special military operation,” was aimed at far more than the rebel territories in the east. Within an hour, Ukraine’s state emergency service said that attacks had been launched in 10 regions of Ukraine, primarily in the east and south, and that reports of new shelling were “coming in constantly.”

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, called it “a full-scale invasion of Ukraine” and said his country would defend itself, while calling on the world to “stop Putin.”

Russia’s Defense Ministry said that it was using “high-precision weapons” to disable military infrastructure, air defense facilities, military airfields and Ukrainian army planes, Russia’s state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. But the ministry said it was not attacking cities, and promised that “the civilian population is not at risk.”

The Ukrainian authorities said that invading naval forces were coming ashore at multiple points, including in Kharkiv and the southern city of Kherson. Three emergency workers were injured when a command post was struck by shelling in Nizhyn, in the north, and six people were trapped under rubble when the city’s airport came under attack, Ukraine’s Interior Ministry reported.

Military depots, warehouses and National Guard were hit with artillery blasts, the ministry said.

As dawn broke in Kyiv, Mr. Zelensky of Ukraine said he had declared martial law. The country’s defense minister told citizens that the army was “fending off enemy forces” and “doing everything it can to protect you.”

But the army was under siege. In the east, Russia-backed separatists — their ranks bolstered by the arrival of hundreds of Russian mercenaries in recent days, according to European officials — said they were hammering Ukrainian troops along the entire 250-mile front line that has divided the rebels and Ukrainian forces since 2014.

Seeking to capture the entire territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, which Mr. Putin recognized as independent on Monday, the rebels were “using all weapons at their disposal,” the Russian news media reported. Ukrainian officials said the attacks included artillery strikes.

Ukraine’s state border service reported that Russian troops stationed in Belarus, north of Ukraine, had launched an attack with support from the Belarusian military. Russia had deployed as many as 30,000 troops to Belarus for exercises this month that the United States warned could provide cover for an attack against Kyiv, which lies a fast 140-mile drive away from a main border crossing. President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus denied that his forces were involved.

By midmorning in Kyiv, Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had disabled all of Ukraine’s air defenses and air bases. Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian forces had captured two villages in the Luhansk region.

The fighting intensified as Ukrainian forces shot down six Russian fighters and a helicopter in a fight to maintain control over key cities, a senior Ukrainian military official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to release information outside official channels. Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, called on all Ukrainian civilians to join the fight and enlist with territorial defense units.

“Ukraine is moving into all-out defense mode,” he said."

In January of 1912, the tail end of the Gilded Age, travelers could flee the northeastern winter by heading to New York's Penn Station and purchasing a luxury sleeping compartment on the Havana Special train. Leaving at 10:05 p.m. nightly, the locomotive whistled down the Atlantic coast in a mere 36 hours to balmy Miami, while passengers dined on Floridian seafood and succulent fruit. Around dawn on the second day, the same train continued south for 156 miles into America's most tropical region on the new ""Key West Extension""—a single line of rail track that soared above the mangrove swamps and coral specks of the Keys, the wild archipelago that carves a delicate arc through the turquoise shallows for 150 miles south of Miami, between the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. By 10 a.m., it was chugging at 15 miles per hour across the most famous and spectacular of the Extension's 40-plus spans, popularly known as the Seven Mile Bridge. As the name suggests, it crossed seven miles of open ocean, supported by concrete pylons embedded in the golden, shifting sands.

Travelers gazed in awe at the sparkling emerald water through windows on both sides of the carriage. It was as if they were flying: In the shallows some 18 feet below, they might spot dolphins, sharks, turtles or the four-feet-long tarpon prized by game fishermen. The famous writer and Keys fan, John Dos Passos, later called the trip in a letter to his friend Ernest Hemingway, ""a dream journey.” And while many travelers stayed in Key West—even before the building of the railway, it was Florida's largest city, a thriving port of 20,000 souls—others would hop directly onto a steamer bound for Havana, Cuba.

The brilliantly engineered railway, commonly referred to by contemporaries as ""the Eighth Wonder of the World,"" was the brainchild of one of America's lesser-known robber barons, Henry Flagler. Although less notorious today than titans like Andrew Carnegie or J. P. Morgan, Flagler was once a household name as a co-founder of Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller. He was one of the world's richest men by the 1880s, but instead of resting on his laurels, he embarked on a risky second career in his mid-50s building railways and luxury hotels in Florida—then the last frontier of U.S. travel—that transformed lonely stretches of sand, including Palm Beach, into thriving metropolises. (His Palm Beach mansion remains as a museum; downtown Miami's 12th Street, where he founded the city's first hotel, is now Flagler Street). His Florida East Coast Railroad Company (FEC) opened up the state to the rest of the U.S. in the 1890s. But Flagler was already 75 years old in 1905 when he approved the wildly ambitious Key West Extension linking Miami to the Keys, a series of coral clumps dismissed by one contemporary writer as ""worthless, chaotic fragments... (that) have been aptly called the sweepings and debris which the Creator hurled out to see when he had finished shaping Florida,"" cites author Les Standiford in his classic account Last Train to Paradise.

For the next seven years, Flagler pumped over $27 million (a then-fantastical sum) into a railway project that many engineers considered impossible. According to Standiford, some thought that he wanted to impress his third wife, Mary Lily Kenan, who was 37 years his junior. Others thought that he was competing with his former partner, John D. Rockefeller, who had by then become more famous. Quite possibly, Standiford suggests, the visionary project was a grasp at immortality. By creating a legacy, Flagler thought his place would be secured in the history books—at the same time (not incidentally) as producing a tidy profit for him along the way. Flagler's larger dream was to turn Key West into a trade gateway to the Panama Canal then being built, bringing U.S. goods to Latin America and returning with cigars, sugar, fish and fruit.

Then again, Flagler may simply have been driven by the era's desire to conquer nature, like the mountaineer George Mallory, who notoriously explained his own mad (and fatal) passion for summiting Mount Everest in 1923: ""Because it's there."" The Upper and Middle Keys had only a few fishing settlements, and residents even in the bustling port of Key West traveled just as they had when it was a pirate outpost generations before—by boat.

The magnate proved any naysayers wrong on January 21, 1912, when the first train rolled from Miami into Key West, carrying the jubilant Flagler and his wife in their private luxury carriage complete with a copper roof, elegant dining room and Victorian-style velvet-and-mahogany lounge. Standiford posits that it was as significant a leap forward for U.S. transport as driving the “golden spike” in Utah in 1869 to open the Transcontinental Railroad. Flagler was 82 years old and with failing eyesight when he stepped onto the newly constructed 1,700-foot pier in Key West harbor, built so that passengers could stroll onto the steamers bound for Havana. A crowd of 10,000 greeted him as a hero, with brass bands and local schoolchildren singing his praises. “I can hear the children but I cannot see them,” he confided to his chief of railroad operations, Joseph Parrott. He also whispered: “Now I can die happy. My dream is fulfilled.”

And yet, opening with great fanfare three months before the sinking of the Titanic, the train became a similar example of man's hubris. It enjoyed 23 years of operation, including a golden age during Prohibition, when thirsty Americans flocked to Cuba. But on Labor Day weekend, 1935, a Category 5 hurricane smashed into the Middle Keys—still the most powerful storm to ever reach U.S. shores—and the iron rail tracks tossed from their coral beds like strings of spaghetti. More than 400 people were killed in the storm. Even so, Flagler's dream did not so much disappear as metamorphize. The rails were soon paved over for cars, and by 1982 most of the extension’s antique bridges closed and were replaced by modern bridges, which collectively are known as Highway One, the lifeline of the Keys.

Anyone who drives the stretch from Miami to Key West is bound to be mystified by the ghostly remains of the old railway. Rusting bridges loom in eerie grandeur, like a capitalist Stonehenge.

While most of these relics have been off-limits for decades, one 2.2 mile section of the Seven Mile Bridge from Marathon to Pigeon Key, about two thirds of the way along the route at Mile Marker 45, continued to hold a beloved place in the hearts of Key residents. They used it for walking, biking, rollerblading, fishing and sunset-watching, despite its looming dangers. ""Old Seven,"" as it became fondly known, was closed in 2016 for an ambitious $77 million restoration that would have impressed Flagler. On January 12, it reopened as a ""linear park""—which seized my imagination as a sort of ""tropical High Line,"" a Floridian answer to the elevated rail-to-trail on Manhattan's West Side located a short distance from my New York apartment, that qualifies as one of America's most pedestrian-friendly historical sites.

""With the bridge open, the public is able to enjoy one of the most unique marine environments in the whole world,"" Bernard Spinrad, the president of the community group Friends of Old Seven, told me by email, not long after the ribbon cutting. ""The entire community... and the many thousands of visitors to the Keys will benefit enormously from the bridge’s ‘coming back to life’…forever.""

A few days after the bridge’s reopening, I decided to see whether I could recapture the Gilded Age travelers' sense of wonder by following the route myself, from Miami to Old Seven and onwards to the end of the line, Key West. I wanted to see how much of the Floridian magic remained.

I started off in the Miami hotel most evocative of the Flagler era, the Biltmore in Coral Gables, where many travelers from the north would stopover for a taste of over-the-top Southern luxury, dining in the Italianate atrium beneath bird-filled palm trees and swimming in what was once America's largest hotel pool, surrounded by ancient Roman statues. It was one of a string of majestic hotels created across the state in the wake of Flagler's railroad projects, which arrived in Miami in 1896 and transformed it from a malarial fishing village to a thriving port and tourist destination. ""If it weren't for the train, we could never have established this hotel,"" said the Biltmore's historian, Candy Kakouris.

Of the 882 charted Florida Keys—the name comes from the Spanish cayo, meaning “islet”—only 30 are inhabited, mostly those linked by Highway One. The others are tiny outcrops of reef barely above sea level, and poetic clumps of mangrove, quite a contrast from the brash metropolis of Miami, whose beach fronts lined with pastel Art Deco architecture, upscale cafes and swaying palm trees have made it one of America's most popular urban destinations .

About two and half hours after leaving Miami, past the cheesy dolphin parks and strip malls of Key Largo, I pulled in to Marathon, the gateway for Old Seven. The largest settlement on the Middle Keys covers 13 reef-fringed islands, and was named after a rail worker's remark in 1908: ""Building this railroad has been a regular marathon."" There, the beachfront Isla Bella Resort was decorated with famous prints of Florida birds by the pioneering artist—and regular Keys visitor in the 1830s—John James Audubon. (Despite his love of winged creatures, Audubon liked to shoot his subjects; he sometimes left with thousands of dead birds packed in his luggage to study for his paintings). Early the next morning, I strolled out the hotel front door to a new walkway that runs beneath the modern highway as the access point to the restored bridge.

Stepping onto Old Seven, I was enveloped in sunshine and slapped with fresh salt air. The bridge runs arrow-straight across the water, 16 to 18 feet above the waves, depending on the tides, with freshly paved bike and pedestrian lanes and newly reinforced hand rails. It is more minimalist than New York's beloved High Line, but nature takes up the visual slack with its astonishing palette: the winter skies are a piercing blue, the water below fluorescent green. The ocean horizon sparkling on both sides of the bridge hypnotizes and recaptures the sense of flying through space. Sea birds soar overhead, and at one point I spotted a diamond-shaped stingray drifting across the coral-encrusted shallows. On calmer days, visitors report turtles (five species can be seen in the Keys, including the enormous loggerheads—named after the sailor's mistaken cry when they spotted their shells in the waves, ""Log Ahead!"") and an array of sharks (lemon, blacktip and nurse). One of the most cherished wildlife sightings is the spotted eagle ray, which can leap from water to reveal a wingspan of nine feet and a whip tail.

The reverie threatened to end abruptly after 2.2 miles at a wire fence: in 1982, a steel swing bridge that opened and closed to allow marine traffic was removed, creating a 253-foot gap and cutting all access to the other 5-odd miles of Old Seven. Instead, a wooden gangway now descends to the Keys' most serene and otherworldly venue: Pigeon Key.

A slice of 1912 lost in the tropics, Pigeon Key was used as a workers' camp during the bridge's construction, with some 400 men based here, most of them recruited in industrial cities of the northeast. Back then, life on Pigeon Island was far from idyllic; as was common in the Gilded Age, laborers were underpaid, overworked and lived in crowded conditions. Earlier in the railway construction project, stories had spread through the U.S. that some of Flagler's men had even tried to flee into the swamps but were caught and used as unpaid convicts, causing such a public outcry in 1907 that a New York court tried to charge his FEC railway company with violating post-Civil War rules banning slave labor. The charges were dropped and Flagler, bristling at accusations of acting like a heartless robber baron, improved conditions, but the six-day work week on the Keys remained grueling.

The litany of disasters piled up from day one, so much so that the railway was initially referred to as ""Flagler's Folly."" His 3,000 workers were tormented by Florida's summer heat and mosquito plagues, and quit in droves. Although they managed to dodge the much-feared yellow fever plagues, laborers suffered from dehydration, exhaustion, construction injuries and sometimes rattlesnake bites. Despite early scandals, Flagler by most accounts tried to make life bearable: ""Camps are clean,"" wrote a visiting journalist from the Chicago Tribune, ""food good, pure ice and water supplied to each camp, no liquor sold in or near."" Head nets were even distributed for the bugs. But nothing could control Florida's elements. Camps along the Key West Extension route were hit by hurricanes three out of seven years, the first drowning at least 125 workers who were bunking in houseboats. Construction costs ballooned as engineers imported steel from Philadelphia, hydraulic concrete from Germany and gravel from Chesapeake Bay. Much of the route was not even properly charted: Surveyors were shocked to find an entire mile-long stretch of water that had never appeared on maps.

Crossing such expanses pushed the limits of technology. The Seven Mile Bridge was the most daunting part of the entire route, described by one contemporary writer cited by Standiford as “a matter of launching a railroad straight at the blank horizon of the Atlantic.” If Flagler was tempted to give up, he never let on. Starting in April 1909, a 32-year old civil engineer named William Krome took on the Herculean task of crossing the expanse (which was actually 6.8 miles).

Construction required the round-the-clock work crews based on Pigeon Key to build 746 colossal bridge supports literally in the middle of the ocean. They were in four separate sections due to the varying depths, each one involving different engineering challenges, using barges laden with steam-driven machinery that had to be constantly fed with coal and water, and creating infernal industrial scenes, particularly after dark. After iron pilings were driven down through sand and mud to the bedrock—in some cases, 28 feet below sea level—workers created underwater concrete pedestals assisted by divers in metal helmets with air pumped from above. Iron support spans were then barged one by one from the mainland and secured to the pylons with more concrete, until a ""Gibraltar strong"" (to use one vivid newspaper term from the time) chain had been created upon which to affix the rail tracks. Despite a hurricane hitting in October, the work was miraculously completed on the bridge by the end of 1909. A total of 25,000 tons of steel had been used.

Today, Pigeon Key’s eight vintage wooden cottages, which are mostly used as offices and classrooms, still cluster beneath swaying palm trees, their porches picked over by ibises and roofs guarded by pelicans.

When I met Kelly McKinnon, one the island's four full-time resident staff and executive director of the Pigeon Key Foundation, the nonprofit that oversees the repair of tropical wear and tear and damage from 2017’s Hurricane Irma, at the foot of the access bridge, he assures me, ""It's not always so sleepy here."" The reopening of Old Seven in January brought a flood of eager locals from around the Keys who had impatiently awaited the work's completion. The small ribbon-cutting ceremony turned into a Keys party: ""People were excited. It was like New Year's Eve."" And visitation to the historic islet is going to climb rapidly, McKinnon predicts. Pigeon Key had 216,000 annual visitors when the bridge closed in 2016. The five-acre island played host to everything from concerts to TED talks to fun runs. During its five-year hiatus, only a fraction of that number were able to visit on three daily ferries from Marathon. But in 2022, McKinnon expects numbers to dwarf the old figure. ""Old Seven a big economic engine. It brings people from all over the country, it's recognized all over the world. And Pigeon Island is used by the entire Keys community,"" said McKinnon. Its unique setting strikes old maritime chords. ""If you're going to have an event on a tiny island, whatever it might be, it's pretty cool!”

Saving Old Seven was a communal effort. A decade ago, it seemed probable that the bridge would simply be allowed to decay, its walkway too dangerous to traverse. But restoration was pushed by a network of history-loving Key locals in the group SOS (""Save Old Seven""), which morphed into ""Friends of Old Seven."" The result in 2016 was a creative joint-funding project, with the restoration cost provided by the Florida Department of Transportation, Monroe County and the city of Marathon. Although the bridge's basic structure was intact, it was a painstaking engineering job. Old Seven’s paving had to be mechanically raised by hydraulic jacks in ten-foot sections—a total of roughly 1,100 times—to cut out the original supporting steel girders and replace them with fresh ""I-beams"" manufactured on site, along with new metal panels and rivets, using a total of 2,586,190 pounds of steel. The bridge joints were repaired, and new decking and aluminum pedestrian handrails were added for the walkway, with three layers of anti-rust paint applied. Surprisingly, given how harsh the environment is, the original concrete pylons, McKinnon said, “only needed a scrape.”

From Pigeon Key, I walked back to Marathon then continued driving the 44 miles south to Mile 0 of U.S. Highway 1, Key West, the end point of American road trips. Today, the former pirate outpost has 25,000 year-round residents, scarcely more than when Flagler arrived. But filled with antique mansions garlanded with tropical foliage, it has one of America’s most energetic party towns. Resisting the happy hour crowds by the pool in the Havana Cabana Hotel, I made the pilgrimage to the Gilded Age version of Mile 0, the waterfront terminus where the celebration for Flagler's first train was held that sunny January morning in 1912. The compact, ornate wooden structure, once part of the last rail station, is painted a tasteful lemon, and nearby is a bronze statue of the elderly rail magnate sitting with a cane on a bench. The station has been converted into a fine ""Sail to Rails Museum"" recounting Key West's storybook history, but is almost entirely ignored by the crowds heading to the marina's nautical-themed seafood restaurants and yachts offering sunset cruises.

Flagler’s hoped-for explosion of freight traffic never materialized, and even the stream of travelers escaping to Havana during Prohibition could not provide the revenue the Florida East Coast Railroad Company needed. It was already in dire financial straits when, on Labor Day, 1935, winds began accelerating across the Keys. Standiford records that one former resident pithily observed: ""We saw pretty quickly that this was going to be a son-of-a-bitch.""

Ernest Hemingway, then the most renowned Key West resident—his mansion is today a beloved tourist attraction—secured his fishing boat the Pilar and hunkered down. But as fate would have it, the hurricane landed further north on Matecumbe Key, where residents lived in fragile fishing shacks and some 600 veterans hired as laborers huddled in canvas tents. It escalated to a Category 5 super-storm, with winds of 200 miles per hour—an almost unimaginable force that sent seas surging over the land, reduced visibility to near-zero and turned debris into deadly missiles. As one survivor reported, ""I saw bodies with tree stumps smashed through their chests, heads blown off, twisted arms and legs, torn off by flying timber that cut like flying knives."" A rescue train arrived for residents but its carriages were knocked over by a deadly 17-foot tidal wave, drowning the passengers and sweeping any who escaped out to sea.

When the storm eased, Hemingway was one of many who joined the search parties. He carried food to distribute, but found ""nothing but dead men to eat the grub."" Trees were stripped of leaves, he reported, the earth covered with sand, and dead crayfish and morays. (""The whole bottom of the sea blew over it."") Bodies were recovered from 30 feet up in tree branches. Men were found whose faces were stripped to the bone by blasting sands. Entire buildings had vanished. And Flagler's dream evaporated with them. The railway sold its right-of-way for a paltry $640,000, a fraction of Flagler's investment, and in 1938 the steel tracks were paved over for cars.

On my last night in Key West, I visited the final monument on the trail: Casa Marina, which in 1922 was the last of Flagler's palatial hotels to open its doors. Located on the island's southeastern beach, it is surging with activity, although few of the visitors notice another statue of Flagler in the splendid lobby, or realize that the hotel’s exterior was designed with Spanish arches that echo one of his bridges, the Long Key Viaduct.

I strolled down to the century-old hotel's water sports office—Barefoot Billy's—and signed up for a jet ski tour. Speeding around the turquoise waters, I passed an exhausting array of snorkelers, swimmers, para-gliders, sailors and water-skiers. Throngs were gathered at Mallory Square to watch the stunning sunset, one of Key West's daily tourist rituals.

Floridian nature at its wildest defeated Flagler, but his obsession has allowed the world to enjoy the Keys today. Perhaps that is memorial enough."

KYIV, Ukraine — At 4:30 a.m. on Thursday, Ihor Poshyvailo, the director of the Museum of Freedom here, was woken by the sound of explosions.

He rushed outside to the street and saw airplanes flying overhead, he said. An hour later, he was in a meeting with officials from Ukraine’s Ministry of Culture trying to work out how the country’s museums could protect their collections.

“We had plans for what to do prewar,” Poshyvailo said, “but now it is a war, it’s totally different.”

By the time they considered evacuating the museum’s most prized objects from Kyiv, the roads were already clogged with Ukrainians fleeing west, and they realized it would not be possible, Poshyvailo said.

Although talk of conflict in Ukraine has been building for weeks, some of the country’s museums were badly prepared when shelling and rocket attacks began and Russian troops entered the country Thursday morning. Even if museums and other cultural sites are unlikely to be direct targets of Russian aggression, administrators worry about the security of their collections if fighting escalates and enters urban areas. Some were concerned that Russian nationalists could attack institutions that put forward Ukrainian historical and cultural narratives.

Ukraine is home to thousands of museums, ranging from small, private institutions to major state-owned collections in Kyiv, the capital, and Odessa, a port city on the Black Sea. The state collections include significant works of Ukrainian and Russian art; classical and Byzantine artifacts; and paintings by Bellini, Goya, Rubens and Jacques-Louis David.

The Museum of Freedom, which was founded in 2014, features a collection of around 4,000 objects associated with Ukraine’s pro-democracy struggles, including banners and artworks. Poshyvailo said he feared for some items if Russian troops entered Kyiv before the objects had been moved to safety.

“Our museum is evidence of Ukraine’s fight for freedom,” he said. “Of course I’m fearful.”

State museums, including the Museum of Freedom, need government permission to remove items from their buildings, a process involving a lot of paperwork. Poshyvailo said he applied to do that earlier this month, but other museums hadn’t, and the government had done nothing to make it easier for them as tensions grew in recent weeks.

Poshyvailo said he was moving items from his museum’s collection to storage, but declined to give further details.

He declined to lay blame on Ukraine’s government for a lack of preparation or guidance. “It’s not the government that has done this,” he said. “It’s Putin.”

Another Kyiv museum whose administrators feared for its collection is the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War, which also tells the story of Ukraine’s involvement in other conflicts, including its war with Russia in the country’s east starting in 2014. Yuriy Savchuk, the museum’s director, said he and his staff worked for 12 hours from 6 a.m. on Thursday to move the museum’s most important exhibits to a safe location. It was “a great feat,” he said.

The museum, which stands under Kyiv’s landmark Motherland monument, was a possible target for rocket attacks, he said.

Aleksandra Kovalchuk, the director of the Odesa Fine Arts Museum, said in a WhatsApp message that museum employees were “doing the only thing that we can” to protect its collection. That meant, she said, “hiding arts to the basement. Trying to arrange security. Barbed wire.”

The Odessa Fine Arts Museum’s collection includes more than 10,000 objects ranging from Russian and Ukrainian religious icons, dating to the 16th century and works by contemporary Ukrainian artists. Its events director, Ulyana Dovgan, said the museum was closed on Thursday. Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian troops had landed in the city.

Sergiy Lebedynsky, the director of the Museum of the Kharkiv School of Photography, in an area close to the Russian border that was shelled throughout the day, said in an email on Monday that much of his museum’s collection was in storage in Germany while the museum was being renovated. He would probably “have to evacuate the rest of our collection this week,” he said. Lebedynsky did not reply to requests to comment on Thursday.

Another museum that has removed items from the country is the War Childhood Museum, an organization based in Bosnia and Herzegovina that stages temporary shows around the world exploring children’s experiences of conflict. It had over 300 items in Kyiv that it collected after Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territory in 2014. It has presented those at temporary exhibitions in Ukraine and abroad, including a recent show in Kherson, a Russian-annexed city near Crimea.

Jasminko Halilovic, the museum’s director, said by phone that he traveled to Kyiv last week and took some 40 items needed for future exhibitions back with him to Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Poshyvailo, 54, said he was ready to fight if needed. But first, he had to make sure his collection was safe.

KYIV, Ukraine — At 4:30 a.m. on Thursday, Ihor Poshyvailo, the director of the Museum of Freedom here, was woken by the sound of explosions.

He rushed outside to the street and saw airplanes flying overhead, he said. An hour later, he was in a meeting with officials from Ukraine’s Ministry of Culture trying to work out how the country’s museums could protect their collections.

“We had plans for what to do prewar,” Poshyvailo said, “but now it is a war, it’s totally different.”

By the time they considered evacuating the museum’s most prized objects from Kyiv, the roads were already clogged with Ukrainians fleeing west, and they realized it would not be possible, Poshyvailo said.

Although talk of conflict in Ukraine has been building for weeks, some of the country’s museums were badly prepared when shelling and rocket attacks began and Russian troops entered the country Thursday morning. Even if museums and other cultural sites are unlikely to be direct targets of Russian aggression, administrators worry about the security of their collections if fighting escalates and enters urban areas. Some were concerned that Russian nationalists could attack institutions that put forward Ukrainian historical and cultural narratives.

Ukraine is home to thousands of museums, ranging from small, private institutions to major state-owned collections in Kyiv, the capital, and Odessa, a port city on the Black Sea. The state collections include significant works of Ukrainian and Russian art; classical and Byzantine artifacts; and paintings by Bellini, Goya, Rubens and Jacques-Louis David.

The Museum of Freedom, which was founded in 2014, features a collection of around 4,000 objects associated with Ukraine’s pro-democracy struggles, including banners and artworks. Poshyvailo said he feared for some items if Russian troops entered Kyiv before the objects had been moved to safety.

“Our museum is evidence of Ukraine’s fight for freedom,” he said. “Of course I’m fearful.”

State museums, including the Museum of Freedom, need government permission to remove items from their buildings, a process involving a lot of paperwork. Poshyvailo said he applied to do that earlier this month, but other museums hadn’t, and the government had done nothing to make it easier for them as tensions grew in recent weeks.

Poshyvailo said he was moving items from his museum’s collection to storage, but declined to give further details.

He declined to lay blame on Ukraine’s government for a lack of preparation or guidance. “It’s not the government that has done this,” he said. “It’s Putin.”

Another Kyiv museum whose administrators feared for its collection is the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War, which also tells the story of Ukraine’s involvement in other conflicts, including its war with Russia in the country’s east starting in 2014. Yuriy Savchuk, the museum’s director, said he and his staff worked for 12 hours from 6 a.m. on Thursday to move the museum’s most important exhibits to a safe location. It was “a great feat,” he said.

The museum, which stands under Kyiv’s landmark Motherland monument, was a possible target for rocket attacks, he said.

Aleksandra Kovalchuk, the director of the Odesa Fine Arts Museum, said in a WhatsApp message that museum employees were “doing the only thing that we can” to protect its collection. That meant, she said, “hiding arts to the basement. Trying to arrange security. Barbed wire.”

The Odessa Fine Arts Museum’s collection includes more than 10,000 objects ranging from Russian and Ukrainian religious icons, dating to the 16th century and works by contemporary Ukrainian artists. Its events director, Ulyana Dovgan, said the museum was closed on Thursday. Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian troops had landed in the city.

Sergiy Lebedynsky, the director of the Museum of the Kharkiv School of Photography, in an area close to the Russian border that was shelled throughout the day, said in an email on Monday that much of his museum’s collection was in storage in Germany while the museum was being renovated. He would probably “have to evacuate the rest of our collection this week,” he said. Lebedynsky did not reply to requests to comment on Thursday.

Another museum that has removed items from the country is the War Childhood Museum, an organization based in Bosnia and Herzegovina that stages temporary shows around the world exploring children’s experiences of conflict. It had over 300 items in Kyiv that it collected after Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territory in 2014. It has presented those at temporary exhibitions in Ukraine and abroad, including a recent show in Kherson, a Russian-annexed city near Crimea.

Jasminko Halilovic, the museum’s director, said by phone that he traveled to Kyiv last week and took some 40 items needed for future exhibitions back with him to Bosnia and Herzegovina. But he said around 300 other items had remained in Kyiv, as had the organization’s three full-time staff members in the country. “They want to stay,” Halilovic said. “It’s their country. They have family and friends. And it also seems a privilege to leave, when not everyone else can.”

Years in the making

Volkswagen presented the ID.Buzz as a concept at the 2017 edition of the Detroit auto show. Futuristic-looking and decked out with LEDs, the retro-inspired van was part of an ongoing series of design studies created to preview the different directions that the Wolfsburg-based firm can take its modular MEB platform in. Among others, we saw the 2016 ID. concept, which became the ID.3 hatchback, the ID.Buggy that I drove in California, and, more recently, the ID.Life built to preview an electric, city-friendly crossover tentatively due out in 2025.

On a secondary level, the ID.Buzz also stood out as the latest in a long line of concept cars that explored what a modern-day version of the Bus (which was officially called Type 2) could look like. Stroll through Volkswagen’s archives department and you’ll encounter concepts like the Microbus (2001), the Bulli (2011), and the BUDD-e (2016). None of these vans reached production; the Buzz is the exception to the rule.

What took so long? Volkswagen told me that its engineers had to clear several hurdles before they could make a modern-day Bus a reality. The term “iconic” gets thrown a lot in the automotive industry but the old Bus truly deserves it; it is, along with the original Beetle and the original Mini, one of the most recognizable cars ever built. Funneling this DNA into a van that can be mass-produced and sold globally in 2022 was easier said than done, and Volkswagen took its time because it couldn’t afford to screw up. That meant making the front end as flat as possible, like the original model’s, without ending up with a configuration in which the folks sitting in the front are the crumple zone.

Peeking through the camouflage reveals some of the changes that designers have made to the Buzz since 2017. Most of the LEDs have been erased from the front end, predictably, and the bottom part of the front bumper has a new, more production-friendly look to it. Walk around to the side and you’ll see door handles, which the design study didn’t have, while the back end gets bigger lights connected by a light bar. The overall proportions haven’t changed, however. The Buzz remains big, boxy, and a tribute to the Type 2 without being full-on retro. It’s not as heritage-laced as, say, the New Beetle that entered production in 1997, but it’s also a lot more interesting to look at than your average van.

Inside, well … that’s off-limits for the time being. You wouldn’t be wide of the mark if you assumed that the Buzz packs at least the same amount of technology as Volkswagen’s other ID-badged electric cars, like the ID.4 crossover, and that its interior is at least as spacious as its box-like proportions suggest. Driving aids are part of the package as well, and the Buzz will be used to test autonomous technology in Hamburg, Germany, starting in 2025. And, there’s no frunk: The only thing of interest behind the nose is the windshield washer fluid filler tube. Volkswagen told me that it could have easily added one, but it chose not to in order to keep the front overhang as short as possible.

Van life meets city life

Here’s where we reach a fork in the road. I drove two versions of the ID. Buzz, a passenger-carrying five-seater van and a cargo-hauling panel van, and neither are coming to the United States. We’ll get a long-wheelbase model that will look just like the European model save for the bigger footprint and that hasn’t been unveiled yet. It should offer three rows of seats, though official details remain few and far between.

With that said, the standard-sized Buzz measures 185.5 inches long, 76.3 inches tall, and 78.1 inches wide. For context, it’s about as long as a Tiguan but 10 inches taller and approximately five inches wider. Its weight hasn’t been published yet. Power comes from a rear-mounted motor that draws electricity from an 82-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack to zap the rear wheels via 201 horsepower and 229 pound-feet of torque. Range? Volkswagen says that it should be “similar to the ID. models with the same battery pack,” or around 250 miles. Bi-directional charging will be available, so the van will be able to store juice from solar panels during the day and feed it back to your house.

From behind the wheel, the Buzz feels unlike any van I’ve ever driven — including the original Bus, which I owned (and loved!) as a student 15 years ago. It’s interesting because, on one hand, you know you’re in a van. It’s spacious, almost cavernous, in a way that even the biggest SUVs on the market could only dream of. And yet, it’s stunningly easy to drive. It’s quick off the line thanks to the motor’s instant torque, it’s silent and linear like nearly all electric cars, and one of the most unexpected features is that it turns like a small hatchback. There’s no engine between the front wheels, so Volkswagen managed to dial in a 35-foot turning radius; that’s on par with an eighth-generation Golf’s. Turn the steering wheel and it keeps going, and going … and going. This is a feature that takes the hassle out of driving a van in tight urban areas.

It’s also not as top-heavy as a lot of vans on the market. That’s due to the battery pack: It’s the heaviest part of the car (it weighs over 1,000 pounds in the ID.4) and it’s mounted directly below the passenger compartment so it keeps the center of gravity low. These characteristics make the Buzz fun. Not in a Miata-on-a-twisty-road sort of way, but in the sense that it’s enjoyable because it feels more nimble than it is. The brake energy recuperation system makes one-pedal driving possible, though it can be turned off using a switch near the steering wheel if you’d rather use the brake pedal. It’s either on or off; there’s no intermediate setting for drivers who want just a little bit of regeneration.

Towing and payload check in at around 2,200 pounds and 1,289 pounds, respectively, which admittedly isn’t much. Outfitting one as a camper or pulling a small trailer shouldn’t be a problem, but don’t expect to tow your old Beetle to the next swap meet with a Buzz.

Here comes your van

Volkswagen will begin building the people- and cargo-carrying variants of the ID. Buzz in Hanover, Germany, during the first half of 2022, and the first units are scheduled to reach dealers across Europe before the end of the year. Pricing has not been released yet. The long-wheelbase model that will be sold in the United States will be unveiled soon, and expect to see it in showrooms in 2024 at the latest. Will it be a volume model? Not by any stretch of the imagination. But, if there’s one car that can make America fall in love with vans again, this is it.

Guessing that different battery sizes and dual-motor all-wheel-drive will be made available at some point in the production run wouldn’t be taking us too far in the hopscotch game of speculation. This is a modular platform, after all, and taking advantage of it makes sense from an economics standpoint. More space between the wheels means more space for battery cells, but nothing has been announced as of writing.

Haven’t we been here before?

In our market, the original Bus was exclusively available with an air-cooled flat-four engine. And yet, electrification was already on Volkswagen’s mind in the 1970s, due largely to the rising cost of oil. Several battery-powered prototypes were built, and 10 of them were purchased by the Electric Power Research Institute and assigned to the Tennessee Valley Authority for testing in various conditions. Shown below, these experimental vans looked just like the regular-production model with the exception of powertrain-specific graphics, cooling vents added to the sliding doors to keep the battery’s temperature in check, and a charging port installed next to the driver-side rear light.

Looking at the specifications sheet reveals how far electric technology has come in the past decades. Power for the electric Bus came from 72 lead-acid batteries stuffed under a raised floor and a motor bolted to a stock four-speed manual transmission locked in second gear. Drivers had 23 horsepower under their right foot, which was enough for a top speed of 43 mph. Driving range checked in at about 25 miles in ideal conditions, though the prototypes were fitted with a primitive brake energy recuperation system and the battery pack could be swapped out.

Vladimir Putin used glossy language to describe Russia's invasion into Ukraine, calling it a “special military operation.”

But Rep. Mike Quigley (IL-05) and congressional leaders across the country see it for what it really was: An “unprovoked attack” to dominate a democratic neighbor. It’s an action that’s being compared to Germany’s invasion of its European neighbors 80 years ago.

It begins “a war of choice entirely of President Putin’s making, despite months of intense diplomacy,” Quigley, a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, said in a statement. “The price that Ukrainians will pay for that choice is unfathomable.”

Sen. Dick Durbin tweeted last night that the invasion was “a dire threat to the established international order and must be resolutely deterred.”

Illinois senior senator, who is of Lithuanian descent, added: ”As someone who has strong ties to the region, my prayers are with the Ukrainian people and all of Eastern Europe.”

THE BUZZ

JOB OPENING: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is gearing up for a process to fill the council seat that opened up when Patrick Daley Thompson was forced out by a conviction.

A four-person search committee will screen and interview applicants before narrowing down candidates that will advance to the mayor, who will make the final pick. The council will then give the final thumbs up or down.

This all seems like a standard hiring procedure, but the 5th Floor hasn’t always been known for following employment handbooks.

Ald. Silvana Tabares, for example, was appointed by former Mayor Rahm Emanuel to replace Mike Zalewski, who retired in 2018. There initially were a number of applicants, but most dropped out once it appeared Tabares’ selection was a done deal because she was backed by former House Speaker Michael Madigan.

In 2013, Emanuel appointed Deb Mell alderman in the 33rd Ward after a screening of candidates found she was the best person to replace the outgoing alderman at the time: her father, Dick Mell.

This time, a committee is interviewing candidates for the open seat. The mayor’s floor leader, Ald. Michelle Harris is on the panel, but otherwise the group’s members don’t seem chummy with Lightfoot or the Daleys, who are still a force in the 11th Ward.

Also on the committee: attorney Salvador Cicero, community leader Grace Chan McKibben (she heads the Coalition for A Better Chinese Community), and radio host Jamie Trecker.

Chan McKibben’s voice on the committee is a signal that the mayor may appoint an Asian American person to the seat. The Asian community already has considerable sway in the ward and the upcoming remap is expected to make that even more potent.

Lightfoot told reporters Wednesday she’s “open” to appointing someone who’s Asian American. “I’m going to pick who I believe is going to serve that community the best,” she said after the City Council’s regular meeting. “Somebody who has a great knowledge and passion for that community, which is very diverse. I want to make sure that we have someone who understands what it takes to be an alderman, which is a very hard job.”

Candidates have until March 11 to submit applications to City Hall or by email to [email protected].

Once the application process closes, names and resumes of each applicant will be made public. A final candidate will be selected by Lightfoot with the goal of being sworn in at the March 23 City Council meeting. The newly appointed alderman will remain in place until the next municipal election in February 2023.

TRIVIA

WEDNESDAY'S ANSWER: Congrats to attorney Graham Grady and University of Chicago political science professor John Mark Hansen for correctly answering that Abner Mikva was the “nobody nobody sent.”

h/t to Jacob Mikva, who of course got it right because he’s the grandson of Abner Mikva. And props to Jack Leyhane for giving the most complete answer:

“The late Abner J. Mikva, who became quite a Somebody, tried (and failed) to volunteer for the 8th Ward Regular Democratic Organization in 1948. Mikva is quoted in Milton Rakove's ‘We Don't Want Nobody Nobody Sent’: “The year I started law school, 1948, was the year that Douglas and Stevenson were heading up the Democratic ticket in Illinois. I was all fired up from the Students for Douglas and Stevenson and passed this storefront, the 8th Ward Regular Democratic Organization. I came in and said ‘I wanted to help.’ Dead silence. ‘Who sent you?’ the committeeman said. I said, ‘Nobody.’ He said, ‘We don't want nobody nobody sent.’”

ABSTRACT-



Global Air Fresheners Market to Reach US$21 Billion by the Year 2026

Traditionally, air fresheners have been used for spreading aroma by filling a closed environment with fragrance. Air fresheners are typically used at hotels, public restrooms, malls, corporate offices, and houses. These devices can impart an aroma in a specific space or mask bad odor in commercial interiors such as vestibules, hallways, restrooms, and foyers. Old and traditional air fresheners, which are mainly composed of hazardous chemicals, are now being replaced by natural and new fresheners. Air fresheners are also available in form of specialty products. These air fresheners have been designed in several forms, such as potpourri. Such air fresheners consist of different forms of natural ingredients such as spices, wood chips, fruits, and flowers that can fragrance oils. Rise in luxury home construction due to rapid urbanization; rising income levels of consumers; a growing number of care facilities; increasing concern about indoor air quality; and rising utilization of public transportation facilities such as trains, buses, taxis, cars, airports, and airplanes are the most significant factors spurring the demand for air fresheners. Growing importance of clean and fresh environment, product innovations and launches improving lifestyle, rising significance of aromatherapy in home, increasing population, surging disposable income, and rising car sales are the other prominent factors fueling the growth of the market.

Amid the COVID-19 crisis, the global market for Air Fresheners estimated at US$16.2 Billion in the year 2022, is projected to reach a revised size of US$21 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 6.2% over the analysis period. Sprays/Aerosols, one of the segments analyzed in the report, is projected to grow at a 6.7% CAGR to reach US$9.9 Billion by the end of the analysis period. After a thorough analysis of the business implications of the pandemic and its induced economic crisis, growth in the Electric segment is readjusted to a revised 5.9% CAGR for the next 7-year period. This segment currently accounts for a 31.8% share of the global Air Fresheners market. Technological advancements and product innovations are emerging into powerful growth drivers. For instance, the development of electrical air fresheners reversed the growth pattern in the US air freshener market, and today the segment ranks as one of the promising segments in the industry. The emergence of battery-powered air fresheners further boosted the electric air freshener segment. Increasing demand for aerosols from households for home care is the key factor propelling the growth of the segment.

The U.S. Market is Estimated at $3.5 Billion in 2022, While China is Forecast to Reach $2.6 Billion by 2026

The Air Fresheners market in the U.S. is estimated at US$3.5 Billion in the year 2022. The country currently accounts for a 21.41% share in the global market. China, the world's second largest economy, is forecast to reach an estimated market size of US$2.6 Billion in the year 2026 trailing a CAGR of 8.5% through the analysis period. Among the other noteworthy geographic markets are Japan and Canada, each forecast to grow at 4.9% and 6% respectively over the analysis period. Within Europe, Germany is forecast to grow at approximately 5.3% CAGR while Rest of European market (as defined in the study) will reach US$1.2 Billion by the end of the analysis period. North America and Europe are the major markets for air fresheners market. Growth in the regions is significantly impacted by the rising awareness among consumers about environmental and health concerns, including the hazards of using aerosol sprays. The factor has acted as a key in propelling the demand for candle air fresheners and aromatherapy in the region. Asia Pacific is forecast to witness a significant rate of growth owing to improved lifestyles, inherent demographic factors, growing population, and rising purchasing power in countries such as India, Malaysia, and China.

Gels Segment to Reach $2.3 Billion by 2026

Gel air fresheners possess a significant growth potential owing to the rising usage of gel fresheners in cars. Gels account for a major share of the car air fresheners market due to the capability of spreading fragrance consistently and evenly for an extended period of time and appealing look. The launch of new plant-based extract products is anticipated to drive the market growth of car air fresheners. In the global Gels segment, USA, Canada, Japan, China and Europe will drive the 6.1% CAGR estimated for this segment. These regional markets accounting for a combined market size of US$1.2 Billion will reach a projected size of US$1.8 Billion by the close of the analysis period. China will remain among the fastest growing in this cluster of regional markets. Led by countries such as Australia, India, and South Korea, the market in Asia-Pacific is forecast to reach US$180.6 Million by the year 2026, while Latin America will expand at a 7.5% CAGR through the analysis period.

NFI - BYD ADL Enviro400EV for National Express Coventry - zero-emission battery-electric bus

LARBERT, Scotland, Feb. 17, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (TSX: NFI, OTC: NFYEF, TSX: NFI.DB) NFI Group Inc. (“NFI”), a leading independent bus and coach manufacturer and a leader in electric mass mobility solutions, subsidiary Alexander Dennis Limited (“ADL”) and BYD UK jointly announced today that their electric vehicle partnership will supply over 130 battery-electric double deck buses to EV fleet and battery storage specialist Zenobē and National Express, and will support these vehicles with spare parts over a period of 16 years.

The deal will see over 130 BYD ADL Enviro400EV double deck electric buses, all manufactured in Britain by ADL in partnership with BYD, enter service in Coventry from early 2023 as a part of the city’s successful bid to become the country’s first all-electric bus city and take it a huge step closer to replacing around 300 diesel vehicles by 2025.

Zenobē will be providing Electric Transportation as a Service (“ETaaS”) to National Express, financing and managing the full turnkey solution that includes new BYD ADL vehicles, on-board battery replacement, charging and grid infrastructure, a second-life battery system at the depot, unique software to optimise charging, parts, and full operational support.

As part of the agreement, ADL will supply Zenobē and National Express with spare parts for planned preventive maintenance (“PPM”) over a period of 16 years from acceptance of the vehicles.

The work builds on ADL and Zenobē’s existing partnership with National Express, previously providing charging infrastructure and batteries for 29 BYD ADL Enviro400EV electric buses in Coventry and Birmingham in 2020. The project will be financed partly through the partnership between Zenobē and National Express, with some investment also coming from the £50 million grant from the Department of Transport, awarded to the West Midlands Combined Authority for Coventry’s all-electric bus city scheme, enabling the public purse to go further.

Story continues

“As the UK’s leading provider of electric buses, we are delighted to be part of this ETaaS deal with partners Zenobē and National Express,” said Paul Davies, President and Managing Director, ADL. “This innovative model brings together government funding and business innovation to deliver an affordable way of rolling out zero-emission bus fleets at scale. The country will further benefit from the choice of 130 British-built vehicles that ensure money is reinvested into the manufacturing sector and local communities, where they support skilled jobs and apprenticeships at our own facilities, as well as in our extensive supply chain.”

“This really is a globally important deal,” said Steven Meersman, Co-founder and Director, Zenobē. “We are incredibly excited to be leading the way for the electric bus industry, with ETaaS revolutionising the way fleets are electrified. By retaining ownership of the vehicles and taking on the risk of switching to zero-emission, we are giving National Express the use of an electric bus fleet without the hassle of owning one, making the transition to a zero-emission fleet more financially desirable. We’re excited to use our new model to help many more operators and local authorities across the UK – and the world – transition to electric, and ultimately accelerate progress towards net zero and clean air.”

“This ground-breaking partnership with Zenobē further demonstrates our leadership as National Express takes another significant step towards our fully zero emission bus fleet ambition,” said Tom Stables, CEO, National Express UK and Germany. “Through this pioneering new way of working, Zenobē's innovative solution provides us with the reliability and flexibility we need to accelerate the roll-out of our greener, cleaner vehicles, while we focus on delivering an excellent service for the people of Coventry. Buses are already one of the cleanest ways to travel. National Express is making it even cleaner, cheaper and easier, so our new and existing customers can relax knowing that they are doing their bit for the planet if they leave the car at home and travel by bus.”

“The issue of climate change is one that requires immediate action,” said Frank Thorpe, Managing Director, BYD UK. “We believe that this arrangement is a positive, more viable way forward for many public transport operators to swiftly integrate and transition to zero-emission pure-electric bus solutions. National Express has first-hand experience operating BYD ADL eBuses, which utilise BYD’s pioneering battery and integrated electronic technology. With a longstanding knowledge of the UK market, BYD is especially proud to be involved in this project, which is setting a precedent for a new way of accelerating and financing eMobility for a better, greener world.”

Putin of Russia announced on television that he had decided “to carry out a special military operation” in Ukraine, explosions were reported across the country.

Blasts were heard in Kyiv, the capital; in Kharkiv, the second largest city; and in Kramatorsk in the region of Donetsk, one of two eastern Ukrainian territories claimed by Russia-backed separatists since 2014.

Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian troops had landed in the southern port city of Odessa and were crossing from Russia into Kharkiv. Footage captured by security cameras showed Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine from Crimea, the peninsula that Russia seized in 2014.

Rocket attacks targeted Ukrainian fighter jets parked at an airport outside Kyiv, and Ukraine closed its airspace to commercial flights, citing the “potential hazard to civilian aviation.”

More than 40 Ukrainian soldiers were killed and dozens were wounded in the fighting on Thursday morning, said Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.

As air raid sirens blared in Kyiv, the western city of Lviv and other urban areas, residents rushed to take shelter in bus and subway stations. In Kyiv, people packed up their cars and waited in long lines to fill up with gas on their way out of the city. In eastern Ukraine, early signs of panic appeared on the streets as lines formed at A.T.M.s and gas stations.

With attacks across the country, it quickly became clear that Russia’s campaign, whatever Mr. Putin meant by a “special military operation,” was aimed at far more than the rebel territories in the east. Within an hour, Ukraine’s state emergency service said that attacks had been launched in 10 regions of Ukraine, primarily in the east and south, and that reports of new shelling were “coming in constantly.”

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, called it “a full-scale invasion of Ukraine” and said his country would defend itself, while calling on the world to “stop Putin.”

Russia’s Defense Ministry said that it was using “high-precision weapons” to disable military infrastructure, air defense facilities, military airfields and Ukrainian army planes, Russia’s state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. But the ministry said it was not attacking cities, and promised that “the civilian population is not at risk.”

The Ukrainian authorities said that invading naval forces were coming ashore at multiple points, including in Kharkiv and the southern city of Kherson. Three emergency workers were injured when a command post was struck by shelling in Nizhyn, in the north, and six people were trapped under rubble when the city’s airport came under attack, Ukraine’s Interior Ministry reported.

Military depots, warehouses and National Guard were hit with artillery blasts, the ministry said.

As dawn broke in Kyiv, Mr. Zelensky of Ukraine said he had declared martial law. The country’s defense minister told citizens that the army was “fending off enemy forces” and “doing everything it can to protect you.”

But the army was under siege. In the east, Russia-backed separatists — their ranks bolstered by the arrival of hundreds of Russian mercenaries in recent days, according to European officials — said they were hammering Ukrainian troops along the entire 250-mile front line that has divided the rebels and Ukrainian forces since 2014.

Seeking to capture the entire territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, which Mr. Putin recognized as independent on Monday, the rebels were “using all weapons at their disposal,” the Russian news media reported. Ukrainian officials said the attacks included artillery strikes.

Ukraine’s state border service reported that Russian troops stationed in Belarus, north of Ukraine, had launched an attack with support from the Belarusian military. Russia had deployed as many as 30,000 troops to Belarus for exercises this month that the United States warned could provide cover for an attack against Kyiv, which lies a fast 140-mile drive away from a main border crossing. President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus denied that his forces were involved.

By midmorning in Kyiv, Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had disabled all of Ukraine’s air defenses and air bases. Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian forces had captured two villages in the Luhansk region.

The fighting intensified as Ukrainian forces shot down six Russian fighters and a helicopter in a fight to maintain control over key cities, a senior Ukrainian military official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to release information outside official channels. Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, called on all Ukrainian civilians to join the fight and enlist with territorial defense units.

“Ukraine is moving into all-out defense mode,” he said."

ABSTRACT-



Global Air Fresheners Market to Reach US$21 Billion by the Year 2026

Traditionally, air fresheners have been used for spreading aroma by filling a closed environment with fragrance. Air fresheners are typically used at hotels, public restrooms, malls, corporate offices, and houses. These devices can impart an aroma in a specific space or mask bad odor in commercial interiors such as vestibules, hallways, restrooms, and foyers. Old and traditional air fresheners, which are mainly composed of hazardous chemicals, are now being replaced by natural and new fresheners. Air fresheners are also available in form of specialty products. These air fresheners have been designed in several forms, such as potpourri. Such air fresheners consist of different forms of natural ingredients such as spices, wood chips, fruits, and flowers that can fragrance oils. Rise in luxury home construction due to rapid urbanization; rising income levels of consumers; a growing number of care facilities; increasing concern about indoor air quality; and rising utilization of public transportation facilities such as trains, buses, taxis, cars, airports, and airplanes are the most significant factors spurring the demand for air fresheners. Growing importance of clean and fresh environment, product innovations and launches improving lifestyle, rising significance of aromatherapy in home, increasing population, surging disposable income, and rising car sales are the other prominent factors fueling the growth of the market.

Amid the COVID-19 crisis, the global market for Air Fresheners estimated at US$16.2 Billion in the year 2022, is projected to reach a revised size of US$21 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 6.2% over the analysis period. Sprays/Aerosols, one of the segments analyzed in the report, is projected to grow at a 6.7% CAGR to reach US$9.9 Billion by the end of the analysis period. After a thorough analysis of the business implications of the pandemic and its induced economic crisis, growth in the Electric segment is readjusted to a revised 5.9% CAGR for the next 7-year period. This segment currently accounts for a 31.8% share of the global Air Fresheners market. Technological advancements and product innovations are emerging into powerful growth drivers. For instance, the development of electrical air fresheners reversed the growth pattern in the US air freshener market, and today the segment ranks as one of the promising segments in the industry. The emergence of battery-powered air fresheners further boosted the electric air freshener segment. Increasing demand for aerosols from households for home care is the key factor propelling the growth of the segment.

The U.S. Market is Estimated at $3.5 Billion in 2022, While China is Forecast to Reach $2.6 Billion by 2026

The Air Fresheners market in the U.S. is estimated at US$3.5 Billion in the year 2022. The country currently accounts for a 21.41% share in the global market. China, the world's second largest economy, is forecast to reach an estimated market size of US$2.6 Billion in the year 2026 trailing a CAGR of 8.5% through the analysis period. Among the other noteworthy geographic markets are Japan and Canada, each forecast to grow at 4.9% and 6% respectively over the analysis period. Within Europe, Germany is forecast to grow at approximately 5.3% CAGR while Rest of European market (as defined in the study) will reach US$1.2 Billion by the end of the analysis period. North America and Europe are the major markets for air fresheners market. Growth in the regions is significantly impacted by the rising awareness among consumers about environmental and health concerns, including the hazards of using aerosol sprays. The factor has acted as a key in propelling the demand for candle air fresheners and aromatherapy in the region. Asia Pacific is forecast to witness a significant rate of growth owing to improved lifestyles, inherent demographic factors, growing population, and rising purchasing power in countries such as India, Malaysia, and China.

Gels Segment to Reach $2.3 Billion by 2026

Gel air fresheners possess a significant growth potential owing to the rising usage of gel fresheners in cars. Gels account for a major share of the car air fresheners market due to the capability of spreading fragrance consistently and evenly for an extended period of time and appealing look. The launch of new plant-based extract products is anticipated to drive the market growth of car air fresheners. In the global Gels segment, USA, Canada, Japan, China and Europe will drive the 6.1% CAGR estimated for this segment. These regional markets accounting for a combined market size of US$1.2 Billion will reach a projected size of US$1.8 Billion by the close of the analysis period. China will remain among the fastest growing in this cluster of regional markets. Led by countries such as Australia, India, and South Korea, the market in Asia-Pacific is forecast to reach US$180.6 Million by the year 2026, while Latin America will expand at a 7.5% CAGR through the analysis period.

About 60% of the world’s people are expected to live in towns or cities by 2030. Paris has cleared plans for an aerial tramway in its southeastern suburbs.

Other capital cities are rolling out innovative transport plans to try and persuade people to leave their vehicles at home.

As cities search for ways to make their environments cleaner and healthier, alternative methods of transport have become a hot topic.

Rising populations are also putting pressure on cities and their transport networks. Urban populations will expand by almost 700 million globally by 2030, rising to a total of 5.2 billion, according to the United Nations (UN).

That means about 60% of the world’s population will live in towns or cities, up from 57% in 2021, the UN says.

Global traffic congestion increased in 2021 as cities came out of lockdown, according to digital mapping company TomTom’s Traffic Index, which uses data from more than 400 cities.

So how are cities keeping people moving without adding to congestion challenges or worsening air quality? Here are some examples from around the world:

France

The Parisian suburb of Creteil plans to build the French capital’s first aerial tramway after feasibility studies received approval in February. The electric line, named Câble 1, will have five stations along its 4.5 kilometre route and is due to launch in 2025.

The city chose to add an aerial route because traditional land-based options would have been too complex and expensive. The line will have the added benefit of not adding to air pollution.

What is the World Economic Forum doing to encourage healthy living in cities? It can be tough to stay healthy when living in a big city. The Forum is responding through its Healthy Cities and Communities initiative by working to create innovative urban partnerships, which are helping residents find a renewed focus on their physical and mental health. In 2020, the project continued to expand to new locations and has effectively helped communities impacted by COVID-19. Our work is continuing with concrete actions in 2021 where best practices and learnings from all partner cities will be shared, allowing other cities to replicate and scale. In Jersey City, USA the Healthy Cities and Communities initiative is working with AeroFarms to deliver locally sourced vertically farmed greens to people in need. The initiative is also helping homeless people who are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. In Mumbai, India (home to more than 20 million people) the initiative is working with the local startup community and engaging them on multiple sanitation challenges.

Norway

Oslo aimed to become the first major European city to to ban private cars from its centre, announcing a plan in 2015 to remove them by 2019. The city began replacing car parking spaces with bike lanes and created several pedestrian-only zones.

Norway’s capital also created a Climate Budget in 2017, aiming to cut emissions from 1990 levels by 36% by 2020, 50% by 2022 and 95% by 2030. The city set a goal to become carbon neutral by 2050.

The United Kingdom

Ride-hailing company Uber has teamed up with river bus service Thames Clippers to take commuters to work by boat as an alternative to using buses or underground trains.

The move also aims to keep commuters out of private cars, as London continues to find ways to encourage travellers to leave their vehicles at home through initiatives such as increased congestion charges.

The city also has its own cablecar, The Emirates Air Line, which it launched ahead of the 2012 Olympic Games.

Japan

Tokyo rolled out the world’s biggest experiment with self-driving vehicles for the delayed 2020 Olympics, with 80 autonomous buses, minivans and SUVs driving athletes and officials around. The vehicles took specially prepared roads from the Olympic village and routes around venues for the Games.

Japan’s government and car industry are pursuing plans for autonomous driving vehicles with the aim of reducing road fatalities, cutting congestion and emissions and helping meet the needs of an ageing population.

Argentina

The “widest avenue in the world”, Avenida 9 de Julio in Buenos Aires, underwent a makeover in 2013 to improve urban mobility, reduce emissions and improve safety. It previously had 20 car lanes, but the city decided to cut this to 10 and to create several bus-only lanes.

Passengers say the changes have reduced their travel time by an average of half an hour per bus ride, to around 14 minutes."

The Conversation U.S. has spent the past couple of months digging into the history and politics of Ukraine and Russia. We’ve looked at their cultures, their religions, their military and technological capacities. We’ve provided you with stories about NATO, about cyberwarfare, the Cold War and the efficacy of sanctions.

Below, you’ll find a selection of stories from our coverage. We hope they will help you understand that today may feel both inevitable – yet inexplicable.

1. The US promised to protect Ukraine

In 1994, Ukraine got a signed commitment from Russia, the U.S. and the U.K. in which the three countries promised to protect the newly independent state’s sovereignty.

“Ukraine as an independent state was born from the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union,” write scholars Lee Feinstein of Indiana University and Mariana Budjeryn of Harvard. “Its independence came with a complicated Cold War inheritance: the world’s third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons. Ukraine was one of the three non-Russian former Soviet states, including Belarus and Kazakhstan, that emerged from the Soviet collapse with nuclear weapons on its territory.”

The 1994 agreement was signed in return for Ukraine giving up the nuclear weapons within its borders, sending them to Russia for dismantling. But the agreement, not legally binding, was broken by Russia’s illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014. And today’s invasion is yet another example of the weakness of that agreement.

Read more: Ukraine got a signed commitment in 1994 to ensure its security – but can the US and allies stop Putin's aggression now?

2. Clues to how Russia will wage war

During the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Russia invaded Georgia, a country on the Black Sea. In 2014, Putin ordered troops to seize Crimea, a peninsula that juts into the Black Sea and housed a Russian naval base.

West Point scholar and career U.S. special forces officer Liam Collins conducted field research on the 2008 and 2014 wars in Georgia and Ukraine.

“From what I have learned, I expect a possible Russian invasion would start with cyberattacks and electronic warfare to sever communications between Ukraine’s capital and the troops. Shortly thereafter, tanks and mechanized infantry formations supported by the Russian air force would cross at multiple points along the nearly 1,200-mile border, assisted by Russian special forces. Russia would seek to bypass large urban areas.”

3. Spies replaced by smartphones

If you love spy movies, you’ve got an image of how intelligence is gathered: agents on the ground and satellites in the sky.

But you’re way out of date. These days, writes Craig Nazareth, a scholar of intelligence and information operations at the University of Arizona, “massive amounts of valuable information are publicly available, and not all of it is collected by governments. Satellites and drones are much cheaper than they were even a decade ago, allowing private companies to operate them, and nearly everyone has a smartphone with advanced photo and video capabilities.”

This means people around the world may see this invasion unfold in real time. “Commercial imaging companies are posting up-to-the-minute, geographically precise images of Russia’s military forces. Several news agencies are regularly monitoring and reporting on the situation. TikTok users are posting video of Russian military equipment on rail cars allegedly on their way to augment forces already in position around Ukraine. And internet sleuths are tracking this flow of information.”

Read more: Technology is revolutionizing how intelligence is gathered and analyzed – and opening a window onto Russian military activity around Ukraine

4. Targeting the US with cyberattacks

As Russia edged closer to war with Ukraine, cybersecurity scholar Justin Pelletier at Rochester Institute of Technology wrote of the growing likelihood of destructive Russian cyberattacks against the U.S.

Pelletier quoted a Department of Homeland Security bulletin from late January that said, “We assess that Russia would consider initiating a cyberattack against the Homeland if it perceived a U.S. or NATO response to a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine threatened its long-term national security.”

And that’s not all. “Americans can probably expect to see Russian-sponsored cyber-activities working in tandem with propaganda campaigns,” writes Pelletier. The aim of such campaigns: to use “social and other online media like a military-grade fog machine that confuses the U.S. population and encourages mistrust in the strength and validity of the U.S. government.”

Read more: Russia could unleash disruptive cyberattacks against the US – but efforts to sow confusion and division are more likely

5. Will war sink Putin’s stock with Russians?

“War ultimately requires an enormous amount of public goodwill and support for a political leader,” writes Arik Burakovsky, a scholar of Russia and public opinion at Tufts University’s Fletcher School.

[Over 140,000 readers rely on The Conversation’s newsletters to understand the world. Sign up today.]

Putin’s support among Russians has been rising as the country massed troops along the Ukrainian border - the public believes that its leaders are defending Russia by standing up to the West. But Burakovsky writes that “the rally ‘round the flag effect of supporting political leadership during an international crisis will likely be short-lived.”

Most Russians, it turns out, don’t want war. The return of body bags from the front could well prove damaging to Putin domestically.

“It feels so good in here today,” she said Thursday, just after 5 a.m.

A neon-orange extension cord beneath her feet ran power to the space heater in the bedroom where her sleeping daughters, 10 and 2, snuggled together under a blanket.

The temperature outside was 49 degrees.

“I’m just so used to the cold, I guess,” she said. “This seems warm to me.”

James, 38, is one of countless Washingtonians who have weathered a frigid winter without working or adequate heat in their homes — a persistent issue that advocates and D.C. officials say is difficult to quantify or address despite the dangers it presents.

D.C. residents who have struggled to keep their homes warm this winter said seeking help through official channels often feels fruitless and frustrating. Several said they have resorted to sealing off windows with plastic, running space heaters day and night or holing up with children and pets in one bedroom. Still, others have turned to boiling pots of water or leaving stoves burning. One resident said she resorted to taking “bird baths” using water boiled in a stock pot to clean and warm her body.

News that a January apartment fire in New York City that killed 17 people, including eight children, was likely sparked by a faulty electrical heater rattled D.C. residents who recognized their own struggles in the circumstances of the Bronx apartment dwellers who had suffered in the blaze.

“I bought some fire insurance after I heard about that because I know there are people in this building just like that — running two space heaters and their stove to keep their apartments warm,” said Cornelia Hill, 59, the tenant association president at Woodberry Village in Southeast D.C., where residents say inconsistent and inadequate heat, among other problems, has plagued them for months.

DCRA, the agency charged with enforcing the District’s regulations for temperature in dwellings, said it was not immediately able to provide a count of how many heat-related complaints the District receives annually.

D.C. fire department officials said they do not track how many fires are sparked by portable heating devices during the cold-weather season. While Fire Marshal and Deputy Fire Chief Mitchell Kannry said heat-related fires are “not the majority,” he warned space heaters and ovens can be hazards.

“Whenever the weather gets colder, we see a rise in the number of structure fires,” Kannry said. “Supplemental heating devices and heating systems can be a source for a fire. Space heaters that are too close to combustibles, like a bed or a couch — you want three feet between those and the devices — or space heaters plugged into a power strip or an extension cord. That’s where we see a lot of problems. Sometimes residents use their ovens to heat their houses, and that’s something we’re really concerned about because carbon monoxide poisoning can be deadly.”

D.C. law states that between Oct. 1 and May 1, indoor temperatures in homes are required to be no less than 68 degrees Fahrenheit and property owners must provide a central “non-portable” heat source to tenants.

“Space heaters are generally not permitted as a primary heating source,” a DCRA spokesman wrote in an email. When responding to a building without heat, the agency will allow supplemental heat sources to be used to heat residences on a temporary basis “depending on weather conditions” if the main heat source is out, the spokesman said.

DCRA treats heat complaints as emergency maintenance issues, officials said, and contacts the property owner “immediately” to advise them of the issue and schedule an inspection. If “a proper heat source” is not found, the spokesman said, the property will be deemed uninhabitable and tenants may be relocated through the Office of the Tenant Advocate.

DCRA declined to comment on specific cases, but tenant advocates and residents in apartment buildings throughout the District that primarily house low-income residents of color said the agency has been slow to respond to heat-related complaints and that fines levied against property owners did little to fix the problem.

James, a single mother who juggles two jobs while caring for her two kids, said trying to get someone to help restore her apartment’s heat has felt like another job. She has meticulously documented the indoor temperature with a point-and-shoot thermometer and her phone camera — capturing temperatures in the 50s throughout the apartment. Last month, she walked a DCRA investigator through her unit. The agency ordered that the heating system be replaced within seven days. The deadline came and went.

When she called building maintenance for help as the temperature plummeted during a snowstorm, James said, she was told to leave her oven on and boil pots of water.

The cloud of steam got trapped in the kitchen. Her daughters’ room still felt like an ice box.

“There’s no sense of urgency, none,” said James, who works as an information technology contractor and supermarket manager. “[The maintenance] guys all go home to a warm house every night, but they are literally telling me to run cords to my bedroom so the sockets don’t get extra hot or they’ll melt just so I can have heat for my kids.”

Lesley T. Kowalski, the director of corporate services for CIH Properties, Inc., which manages Banneker Place Apartments, wrote in an email Thursday that “it is inaccurate to state that heat” to James’s building “has been insufficient or inadequate throughout the winter.” The building, she added, has two boilers, one of which “recently” malfunctioned. Kowalski said a plumber was sent to the building Thursday morning to repair the malfunctioning boiler.

At Woodberry Village, after years of inconsistent heat, residents had been assured that the temperature control systems would be updated in 2021 during a large-scale renovation that cost millions of dollars. But those who moved back into revamped units said familiar problems emerged, including no heat.

Nancy Smith, 50, said the heat in her renovated unit has gone out twice since December for several days at a time during cold snaps. Management gave her two space heaters, Smith said, but running them tripped the breaker, shutting down half the electricity in her apartment. She ended up keeping her oven on for days.

“Right now I’m just hoping the heat holds up until the weather gets warm again,” she said.

A spokesperson for Capital Realty Group, which manages the Woodberry rehabilitation project, declined to comment Friday evening.

Several Woodberry Village residents said they filed complaints with DCRA and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversees voucher programs for a number of residents on fixed incomes.

Tenant advocates said inconsistent heat is a challenge for code enforcement officers, who may arrive to inspect a building after the heat has been restored and not find any problems.

Last month, the D.C. attorney general’s office filed a lawsuit against the owner of Hawaii-Webster Apartments in Northeast Washington for allegedly using harassment and poor conditions to push longtime residents out in order to redevelop the property and charge market-rate rents.

Among the problems, some residents said, is they spent weeks without heat.

Cynthia Williams, 77, said she ran a space heater into her bedroom and then barely left its side for most of November and December.

Williams, who suffers from arthritis and sciatica, said her body pains worsened as the temperature in her unit dropped.

“It was miserable,” said Williams, who noted her heat returned in January. “When I cooked it got warm for a little while, but I was not going to keep my stove on — no, no, no,” she said, noting the risk of fire and carbon monoxide poisoning.

In its lawsuit, D.C. wrote that 17 units across nine buildings in the complex lacked heat from mid-November through mid-December. Tenants who rely on space heaters to stay warm have also dealt with increased electrical bills not covered by the property owner, the lawsuit states.

The owner of the Hawaii-Webster Apartments, Mark Mlakar of M Squared Real Estate LLC, has twice been cited by DCRA for failing to provide adequate heat to tenants, according to court documents. Mlakar has not responded to a request for comment.

The D.C. attorney general’s office is seeking a receiver in the Hawaii-Webster Apartments case — a third-party appointed by and answerable to the court who oversees repairs needed to bring the building back up to code.

Another lawsuit alleging neglect and hazardous living conditions underway at Marbury Plaza has documented a lack of air conditioning in the summer, but it was filed before inspectors could see what happens there in the winter. Residents of the Southeast Washington complex said they spent about a week without heat and several without hot water in their units during the coldest months of the year.

Managers for Marbury Plaza declined to comment.

As spring approaches, organizers caution, cold-weather problems will fall further down the priority list.

For James, though, springlike weather also means allowing her daughters to eat oatmeal together in a room that earlier this week was too cold to sit in rather than grab-and-go food in the car.

“I’ll take it,” she said, then turned to fold up a fleece blanket draped over her desk chair."
