The company has conducted multiple flights between its headquarters at Burlington International Airport in Vermont and nearby Plattsburg in New York. The longest flight to date with the all-electric aircraft, which uses fixed-pitch propellers, was 205 miles and it has cruised at altitudes of 8,000 feet.\n\n“This partnership with the Army marks another important step in the military’s commitment to advancing and adopting sustainable electric aviation solutions,” said Beta founder and CEO Kyle Clark. “We’re gratified by the continued support of the sector, and this allows us to accelerate our development of Alia as an incredibly safe and reliable logistics aircraft for both military and civil applications.”\n\nThe company’s board of directors includes Will Roper, the former U.S. assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, technology, and logistics.

Kyle Clark is an aviation pioneer. That’s not simply because his Burlington, Vermont-based company, Beta Technologies, is among the dozens racing to develop electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft large enough to serve a useful commercial purpose. It is, instead, because he’s one of the handful of people in the world who has actually flown one. Most large eVTOL aircraft (as opposed to personal flying machines) remain in the concept phase. Of the prototypes that have actually flown, most that we know of have done so unmanned. That hasn’t stopped their developers — who are primarily focused on the air taxi market — from hyping them as revolutionary machines that will transform how we move around crowded cities, starting as early as 2023, if Uber’s “Elevate” vision comes to pass. Meanwhile, Clark has been quietly going about the business of flying his own vectored thrust eVTOL demonstrator, dubbed Ava XC. The program is funded by the biotechnology company United Therapeutics, which hopes to eventually use a successor to Ava to transport its manufactured organs — an application that’s much more feasible in the near term than the speculative air taxi market. The aircraft is built around a Lancair ES cabin, with fixed wings and tail provided by the experimental aircraft developer RDD Enterprises. Lightweight carbon fiber outriggers developed by Blue Force Technologies extend from either side of the nose and tail, providing mounting points for four pairs of counter-rotating proprotors, each driven by a pair of 124-horsepower permanent magnet motors. The aircraft can take off vertically with its nacelles pointed 90 degrees toward the sky; then, the nacelles tilt forward as far as zero degrees to the horizontal to direct thrust for forward flight. In cruise, most or all of the lift is generated by the 35-foot (10.7-meter) wing, giving the aircraft the efficiency to make the most of its two lithium-ion battery packs totaling 124 kilowatt-hours. At around 4,000 pounds (1,815 kilograms), Ava is the heaviest known eVTOL to fly to date. And Clark hasn’t just been along for the ride like a passenger in a giant drone. As Beta Technologies’ principal test pilot as well as its founder, he is now more than 180 flights into a rigorous, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved testing program designed to map the edges of the aircraft’s flight envelope, and to demonstrate that it can be landed safety even after motor or battery failures. Clark comes to the role as an engineer and serial entrepreneur who has been passionate about aviation since childhood. He started building his first kit plane, an ultralight, in high school, figuring he could get away with Douglas fir even though the plans called for Sitka spruce. “My mother was frightened I was going to hurt myself with the plane that I was building. She actually burned it, and then, feeling bad about it, set up my first training flight at a local airstrip,” he recalled. Clark studied applied math and materials science at Harvard, where he also played ice hockey. He was drafted by the Washington Capitals, and used his signing bonus for flying lessons. By the time he founded Beta Technologies in 2017, Clark, who is now 39, was an accomplished pilot with airplane multi-engine and instrument ratings. However, he didn’t have any helicopter or test pilot experience, and the FAA wasn’t prepared to sign him off for Ava’s flight test program without those additional qualifications. Rather than hand over the program to another pilot, Clark learned how to fly helicopters, then worked with the FAA to meet the qualifications for a powered lift rating — something that until then had been granted only to pilots with military tiltrotor experience. Now, Beta Technologies also has an approved, simulator-based training program that will allow it to sign off additional powered lift test pilots, “which I believe is unique in the industry,” Clark said.\n\nArticle Continues Below\n\nWhile Clark is the driving force behind Beta Technologies, he has assembled an impressive team of experts to bring his aircraft to life. Flight simulation is led by Austin Meyer, the creator of the popular flight simulation software X-Plane. Before settling on Ava’s current configuration, Beta Technologies developed 35 variants, all of which were tested in X-Plane using autopilots written by Meyer. “One of the key, interesting things was the number of lines of code it took to write the autopilot was directly proportional to the complexity of controlling the airplane,” Clark observed. “That was a really good metric to say, ‘Yeah, this is or isn’t an elegantly simple design.'” According to Clark, the autopilot developed for Ava has less than 1,000 lines of code, which “basically demands that you are always taking the simplest way of solving the problem.” That, he said, is reflected in the flight controls, which are of hybrid design. A collective lever in the left hand modulates the speed of the proprotors and therefore thrust, although Clark noted that the control is much lighter than a conventional helicopter collective. Traditional foot pedals control the rudder and the clockwise/counter-clockwise differential of the rotors while hovering, and allow for differential braking during ground taxi. In the right hand is a sidestick similar to what might be found in a business jet, which is coupled to both the mechanical flight control surfaces and the fly-by-wire controller for distributed propulsion. The right thumb controls a bump switch that tilts the nacelles, allowing the pilot to modulate the angle as a function of sink rate. “I liken it to a glassy water landing in a sea plane where you come in . . . and all you’re doing is looking at the VSI [vertical speed indicator] and you’re setting your sink rate,” he said. “The same thing’s true when you’re moving this thing forward — if you can feel anything, you know you’re doing something wrong. So you start to bump that in a particular direction to either increase the vertical component of lift or the horizontal component of thrust.” Whereas high-speed tiltrotors like the Bell-Boeing V22 and Leonardo AW609 limit the range of the nacelles in certain speed envelopes, Ava’s relatively low never-exceed speed of 154 knots makes such protections unnecessary. “You can actually tilt the nacelles skyward, and the aircraft will naturally decelerate, even in a dive, to a speed where you can comfortably pull the collective at a 90-degree vector,” he said. That’s not something that Clark has demonstrated in the actual aircraft yet. Working within the constraints of Beta Technologies’ FAA-approved flight test program at Plattsburgh International Airport in New York, he has been expanding Ava’s flight envelope slowly and methodically, thus far achieving speeds of up to 72 knots and a maximum altitude of 100 feet, and flight in winds as high as 25 knots. A large portion of the flight test program has been devoted to mapping the proprotor transition envelope, both in vector angle and airspeed. “Basically the way that’s done is we fly at different airspeeds at a fixed vector angle to the point where we don’t have enough control margin to continue, and we draw an edge on the envelope at that point,” he said.\n\nArticle Continues Below", {'entities': [(261, 278, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1084, 1090, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (1143, 1162, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (1209, 1212, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (1471, 1486, 'SUPPLIER'), (1537, 1560, 'SUPPLIER'), (1705, 1719, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2000, 2007, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2009, 2019, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2125, 2143, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2155, 2167, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2169, 2184, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2187, 2190, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (2319, 2336, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2432, 2463, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (3343, 3360, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3542, 3545, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (3582, 3585, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (3760, 3763, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (4182, 4199, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (4403, 4406, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (4432, 4449, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (6787, 6804, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (6806, 6809, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (6842, 6875, 'INFRASTRUCTURE'), (6911, 6914, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (6993, 7001, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (7028, 7036, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE')]}), ('"We support Beta Technologies\' mission to reshape air transportation through zero-emission aviation."

Will the company in question provide medical insurance? What about 401(k) retirement plan matching? Oh, and what’s the vacation policy like?\n\nWhile all of those things are clearly important, Burlington, Vermont-based eVTOL developer Beta Technologies has long attached another piece to its benefits package: free flight training. Now, as the company ramps up its testing program and inches closer to its goal of commercializing the all-electric Alia 250 aircraft, that’s something the company — and its employees — believe will give them an upper hand in the increasingly competitive eVTOL space.\n\nBeta CEO Kyle Clark says the company’s pilot training program gives every employee a direct connection to Beta’s mission. Beta Technologies Photo\n\nBeta’s flight training program allows for employees, regardless of their position, to get various certificates and ratings completely on the company’s dime. The eVTOL developer owns and maintains several training aircraft, has 17 dedicated certified flight instructors (CFIs) to work with employees, and leverages an extensive in-house maintenance staff to keep the entire operation running. According to a company spokesperson, Beta’s CFIs — many of whom have previous military or airline experience — average 4,000 hours of flight experience, while its maintenance personnel average 20 years on the job.\n\nFor that reason, while Beta is still an eVTOL developer at heart, the company’s flying operation more closely resembles a flight school or small charter operation. In addition to flight training, Beta also uses its fleet of more than a dozen conventional aircraft for logistics and transportation.\n\nFor intern Bella Riely, flight training allowed her to have a more intimate understanding of aviation concepts and language, which was otherwise absent for someone with little industry experience. “When I came to Beta, it was a full immersion experience: I started working on the scale model and people were talking about ailerons and elevators and I was like, ‘I have no idea what’s happening,’” she said. “So, to be able to get my hands on a yoke and be in the cockpit manipulating flight controls, it helped me connect with the people as well as the aircraft and the job.”\n\nBeta uses its in-house aircraft to help keep its pilot employees safe and current, in addition to introducing non-pilot employees to the joys of flight. Beta Technologies Photo\n\nWhile someone in Riely’s role — who works on 3D modeling and prototyping — may not directly be flying for her job, the knowledge she gains through flight training helps her at her desk. Meanwhile, for Lochie Ferrier, a flight test engineer and pilot for Beta, integrating flying right into his day-to-day activities is vital to program safety, he said. Specifically, Ferrier said that it’s not uncommon for flight test programs to have pilots with multiple month-long gaps in their currency because, in many cases, the actual test aircraft don’t fly that much. For Beta, having dedicated aircraft in house keeps people safe and current during those gaps.\n\nKeeping pilots current this way and expanding the number of people in the company who can fly also creates what Ferrier calls “Swiss army knife” employees, or people who can do lots of tasks and do them well. According to Ferrier, Lan Vu, another pilot who spoke to eVTOL.com, is one of these people. “Lan can watch telemetry, build batteries, fly planes to go build batteries, complete safety reviews, and so on. The whole pilot piece has made Lan to be way more useful to the team I work on for sure,” he said.\n\nVu said that she, like others at the company, had no direct experience with aviation before coming to work at Beta. “I really had no thought I would even fly a plane before working here,” she said.\n\nA full hangar at Burlington International Airport holds the Alia 250 eVTOL and other Beta aircraft. Beta Technologies Photo\n\nVu’s story isn’t unique, and the company’s flight training initiative seems to be producing more and more people like her — coming with no aviation experience, and emerging as a pilot as well as a seasoned Beta employee.\n\n“At Beta, our mission is to build the best electric aerospace company. Our flight program is borne of the belief that there’s no better way to understand flight, and what pilots really need in the aircraft, than to fly yourself,” a Beta spokesperson said. Company CEO Kyle Clark also sees this as a key part of Beta’s overall mission: “Beta’s employee pilot training program gives every Beta employee a direct connection to the company mission,” he emphasized.\n\nAnd while all that’s great, the elephant in the room couldn’t be more obvious: covering flight training costs for a company with hundreds of employees can’t be cheap. While Beta has serious incoming cashflow from investors such as Fidelity Management and Amazon’s Climate Change Fund, and orders on the docket from Blade and UPS, aircraft certification is a fraught and expensive process that is likely to require all of the capital that Beta can throw at it.\n\nHowever, Ferrier sees the flight training program as an interconnected piece of the work the company does, and thus the cost as justifiable. He said that, just as other companies invest in professional development opportunities for employees and other educational perks, Beta’s flight training program operates in a similar manner by providing employees with relevant, useful skills for the job.\n\n“Imagine if everyone who is designing cars at Ford had never driven a car before,” he said. “That car would be really, really bad.”', {'entities': [(328, 345, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (540, 557, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (693, 697, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (799, 803, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (815, 832, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (840, 844, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1053, 1061, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (1269, 1273, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1470, 1474, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1643, 1647, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1702, 1710, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (1959, 1963, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2299, 2307, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (2323, 2327, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2346, 2354, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (2476, 2493, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2755, 2759, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3032, 3040, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (3066, 3070, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3089, 3097, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (3781, 3785, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3887, 3919, 'INFRASTRUCTURE'), (3930, 3944, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (3955, 3959, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3960, 3968, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (3970, 3987, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (4201, 4205, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (4221, 4225, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (4414, 4422, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (4449, 4453, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (4528, 4532, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (4553, 4557, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (4604, 4608, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (4852, 4856, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (4910, 4929, 'INVESTOR'), (4934, 4962, 'PROGRAM'), (4994, 4999, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (5004, 5007, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (5009, 5017, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (5117, 5121, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (5411, 5415, 'UAM_COMPANY')]}), ('If it weren’t for the racket from a helicopter landing on the roof, the complex of heavily modified and interconnected cargo containers in a corner of Burlington International Airport would be a great place to hang out.

The scene smacks of a villain’s lair.\n\nBut this strange outpost isn’t an evil genius’s hideaway or even just a primo plane-spotting perch. Burlington-based Beta Technologies, a three-year-old company that’s developing an electric vertical-lift airplane, created the structure to be a key component in the future of aviation: A charging station for electric aircraft, from pilotless drones to futuristic flying taxis. “It can charge the aircraft, providing accommodations to ‘recharge’ the flight crews, as well, or it can serve as a handoff point for cargo or medical supplies,” says Kyle Clark, Beta’s founder.\n\nThe station is designed for the coming wave of electric air taxis—and their demand for fast and reliable charging, something few of the industry’s players have yet to fully explore. Topping off the larger and more powerful batteries used by electric aircraft could cause even greater strains on the grid than electric cars, which already face challenges in getting steady power delivery from charging stations.\n\nStay in the know with our Transportation newsletter. Sign up here!\n\nBeta developed the stations in tandem with work on its two prototype aircraft, first a small tilt-rotor version called Ava followed by a radically different production version called Alia, set to be revealed within a few weeks. Depending on their configuration, the stations could serve as a charging pad for human-piloted or fully autonomous vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, a landing pad for conventional helicopters, or a way station for cargo deliveries or emergency UAV operations when medical and other supplies are needed during a crisis, such as the current Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nClark says the stations can be set up in tight urban spaces, where the 20-foot-high landing platform would help ensure safe approaches and departures for all types of rotorcraft, whether full-sized passenger-carrying air taxis or small delivery drones. They’re also suitable for remote, undeveloped areas where they would help extend the range of eVTOL craft. The sleeping quarters and lounges allow crews to rest overnight or simply to kick back while their craft charges. These would be particularly useful if secured and installed at low-volume airports that don’t have hotels or other services nearby.\n\nTechnologically, the charging station is an exercise in power management for aircraft charging. “One of the biggest challenges was mitigating the demand that would be created if aircraft were charging directly from the grid,” says Chip Palombini, a Beta engineer, echoing a problem faced frequently at electric car charging stations when the charge rate can be hurt by overall demand.\n\nTo solve the problem, the station would be wired to the grid and augmented by large arrays of “second-life” batteries—repurposed from electric cars and other uses—which can be charged either from the grid or with solar panels. Using proprietary power controllers, the stations can deliver juice to the aircraft quickly and efficiently, Clark says. “The system enables ultra-rapid recharge of large electric aircraft without requiring big power lines to serve the load,” he says.', {'entities': [(151, 183, 'INFRASTRUCTURE'), (319, 345, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (547, 564, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (987, 991, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1484, 1488, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1603, 1606, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (1667, 1671, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (2940, 2944, 'UAM_COMPANY')]}), ('The General Aerospace Manufacturers Association (GAMA) welcomed five new members, including Vermont-based eVTOL developer Beta Technologies and Toyota Motor North America, which has partnered with Joby Aviation on manufacturing its aircraft.\n\nBeta Technologies, a Vermont-based developer of electric aircraft and charging technology, is one of five new members announced by GAMA.

A literal one. He had full control just moments before, but his electric, eight-rotor aircraft was dropping fast.\n\nClark did, however, know this was coming. The founder and chief test pilot of flying car developer Beta Technologies had deliberately put the aircraft into a tricky aerodynamic situation called vortex ring state, or “settling with power.” That’s when the rotors lose lift and the aircraft descends rapidly into air made turbulent by the transition from horizontal flight into a hover. No amount of additional power will allow the aircraft to climb out of it. In fact, adding power can often accelerate the descent. It’s the problem that caused the fatal April 2000 crash of a V-22 Osprey tiltrotor during a test flight, as well as the loss of a Black Hawk helicopter in the 2011 raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden.\n\nIt’s also just one of the many often mystifying aerodynamic challenges that neither pilots nor engineers can see but which they can absolutely feel, thanks to the complex forces swirling around clusters of fast-moving blades and all the spindly bits protruding from the fuselage to support motors, generate lift or control, or support landing skids or wheels. It’s a soupy yet fast-moving environment that will require high-level understanding and eventually virtually infallible management if the aviation world’s vision of a new way of flying has any hope of succeeding.\n\nAircraft makers can minimize the likelihood of vortex ring state with multi-rotor designs that distribute the downwash over a wider area, and pilots learn how to respond to the threat when it happens. As Clark dropped, he sidestepped to the right, moving into cleaner air, where the rotors’ power can be put to use. “I got out just 3 feet above the ground,” he says. “Just because you have a bunch of powerful electric motors and rotors, it doesn’t mean you can simply accelerate out of it.”\n\nThat test—one of about 200 so far—counted as a success for the aircraft, called Ava. The new kind of flying machine retained control despite the loss of lift, much like a conventional helicopter. But managing vortex ring state is just one of many challenges facing the development of this entirely new class of electric, multi-rotor, vertical-lift aircraft, dubbed eVTOL but more popularly known as air taxis or flying cars (for their ease of use, not because they also drive).\n\nAs companies like Lilium, Joby, and Kitty Hawk explore new configurations—with pivoting rotors, wings, moving control surfaces, and more—they must crack the devilish problem of keeping heavier-than-air machines aloft.\n\nMaking an eVTOL aircraft hop off the ground and transition to forward flight is the most pressing challenge here. “We want simplicity in our design and predictable behavior across a wide transition envelope,” Clark says. By that he means making the transition at different speeds and altitudes. “We want it to maintain nice, even responses—what we call control harmony—no matter what config\xaduration it’s in or what the conditions are. We don’t want it to feel firm and precise in one direction but mushy in another.”', {'entities': [(331, 348, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2111, 2114, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (2528, 2534, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2536, 2540, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2546, 2556, 'UAM_COMPANY')]}), ('BETA Technologies has been awarded airworthiness approval for a manned electric aircraft by the US Air Force’s Agility Prime programme, with its ALIA eVTOL aircraft having already begun flying under the air force’s operational flight test program.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force spent more than a year assessing ALIA, conducting deep dives into engineering, operations and flight test capabilities against the demanding military 516c standard. Subject matter experts evaluated every aspect of ALIA for safety, design, and maintenance standards, as well as participated in the flight test campaign planning.\n\nUnder this contract, the air force will have access to the only manned, 7,000-pound class all-electric aircraft known to be flying in the world today. With this kind of open access and evaluation of operational test results, air force acquisition officials will be able to make data driven procurement decisions to best meet the military’s technical needs and will be informed by real assessments of military utility in the field.\n\nIn addition to field and real-life applications in the aircraft flight test program, BETA’s flight simulation and training facilities allow Air Force pilots and engineers to experience the future of eVTOL aircraft by rehearsing and testing ALIA in a variety of potential mission sets and scenarios.\n\nCol. Nathan Diller, Director of AFWERX at the United States Air Force, said: “Achieving the first manned airworthiness authorization in the Agility Prime program is a key milestone. This not only unlocks the opportunity to begin Air Force directed manned flight tests, but it also shows the high level of maturity of this technology and the high level of maturity of Agility Prime partner companies like BETA.”\n\nAgility Prime is designed to leverage and accelerate commercial innovation efforts. In a first of its kind arrangement, AFRL engineers used unique equipment and analysis capabilities to conduct Ground Vibration Testing (GVT), a method of dynamic structural analysis on ALIA. This valuable data provided by the GVT will be used to safely advance the flight test programme safely while providing valuable insight to the US Air Force on novel aircraft design.\n\nThe advanced urban air mobility technology simulator near the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) in Springfield, Ohio, also provides easy access to the Air Force’s technical acquisition workforce, while the Washington, D.C. test facility provides an ideal venue to immerse senior leaders and decision makers in the electrified future. These state-of-the-art simulators are physics based and include weather, emergency handling, battle damage, and advanced mission scenario simulation.\n\nKyle Clark, BETA’s Founder and CEO, said: “Electric aviation is a National Security priority and fortunately this was recognized early by the Air Force. The speed and efficiency of the Air Force Agility Prime program to support sustainable electric aviation has been remarkable. The people and expertise that the Air Force has brought to the electric aviation industry and specifically our ALIA program is accelerating the development of incredibly capable, safe and reliable aircraft.”\n\nLast month, BETA advanced to the next phase of its flight-testing programme, completing an interstate flight with ALIA from Plattsburgh, New York to Burlington International Airport in South Burlington, Vermont.\n\nIn accordance with FAA protocols regarding the ability of experimental aircraft to fly beyond a designated test area, BETA had to complete comprehensive testing to ensure reliable and predictable aircraft handling and performance. In the same week ALIA flew its first interstate flight, the aircraft set a new BETA record for endurance, range, and altitude.\n\nBETA will continue testing aircraft capabilities and mission applicability including range, altitude, endurance and payload limits before testing specific cargo, logistic and other missions.\n\nThe quiet electric propulsion has a very low thermal and acoustic signature, enabling the aircraft to complement existing ground and air vehicles with new capabilities. Cost, maintainability and availability will be tracked and evaluated during operational test and evaluation. All of these benefits come with zero operational emissions, an important part of the Armed Forces sustainability goals.\n\nRecently, BETA added to its growing customer list securing agreements with BLADE and UPS for its ALIA aircraft and charging stations.\n\nBETA Technologies follows on from a similar announcement by Joby Aviation in December 2020, after the company’s four-seater prototype was announced as the the first eVTOL aircraft to provide transportation for military staff.', {'entities': [(0, 17, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (96, 108, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (111, 134, 'PROGRAM'), (145, 164, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (203, 212, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (253, 267, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (301, 305, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (409, 431, 'REGULATION'), (482, 486, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (622, 631, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (669, 680, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (822, 831, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (1114, 1118, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1169, 1178, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (1269, 1273, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (1361, 1367, 'PROGRAM'), (1375, 1398, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (1469, 1482, 'PROGRAM'), (1558, 1567, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (1696, 1709, 'PROGRAM'), (1733, 1737, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1741, 1754, 'PROGRAM'), (1861, 1865, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (1935, 1959, 'TECHNOLOGY'), (1961, 1964, 'TECHNOLOGY'), (2010, 2014, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (2051, 2054, 'TECHNOLOGY'), (2159, 2171, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (2261, 2290, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (2292, 2296, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (2353, 2362, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (2699, 2703, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2829, 2838, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (2872, 2881, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (2882, 2895, 'PROGRAM'), (3000, 3009, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (3077, 3081, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (3187, 3191, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3289, 3293, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (3324, 3356, 'INFRASTRUCTURE'), (3407, 3410, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (3506, 3510, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3636, 3640, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (3698, 3702, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3747, 3751, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (4302, 4314, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (4348, 4352, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (4413, 4418, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (4423, 4426, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (4435, 4439, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (4473, 4490, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (4533, 4546, 'UAM_COMPANY')]}), ("Plattsburgh, New York, is a tough place to be outside in early January. The small city sits on the western shore of Lake Champlain, 20 miles south of the Canadian border. I’ve just arrived with Kyle Clark and a few of his colleagues, after a quick flight in a 40-year-old Cessna from Burlington, Vermont, on the other side of the lake. It’s snowing, and as we shuffle across the mostly abandoned former Air Force base toward a secluded hangar, I ask Clark if the weather might ice today’s flight plans.\n\nHe looks at me and laughs, opening the hangar door. “Not a chance.”\n\nIt’s no surprise that Clark—tall, athletic, copiously tattooed, and a former pro hockey player—doesn’t mind the winter weather. But these seem like conditions that would threaten the test flight of a rather complex, entirely new, fully electric aircraft. One whose eight motors and rotors must work in computerized synchrony to keep the ship aloft and true, whether going up, down, or forward.\n\nClark will have none of such worries. He bounds into the cavernous building that once housed B-52 bombers and introduces me to the Ava XC. The gleaming white contraption, with stilt-like landing gear and eight propellers jutting out in every direction, looks like what Tony Stark would build if he had an Edward Scissorhands phase. It is, in fact, the prototype that Clark’s company, Beta Technologies, has built to not only probe the challenges of electric aviation, but also prove it has the aerospace knowhow itself to compete in the crowded, yet-to-be-realized market for battery-powered vertical takeoff and landing aircraft—what you might call flying cars.\n\nClark’s version, though, appears to be further along than most. It’s one of the few designs relying heavily on a conventional wing to boost efficiency in horizontal flight, and it's the largest known eVTOL aircraft to fly yet. More importantly, it’s the only one with a confirmed launch customer providing funding. The mostly carbon fiber, 4,000-pound aircraft holds two battery packs totaling 124 kWh. The 34-foot wing sits between outriggers supporting the octet of 143-horsepower permanent-magnet motors and propellers, which pivot from horizontal to 90-degrees straight up. The two layers of counter-rotating props operate independently, so if one layer loses power, the other will keep the Ava in the air—one of many redundancies and safety measures in the aircraft. The funky flyer has a 172 mph top speed and a range of 150 miles.\n\nIn the hangar, Clark’s team gets to work preparing the craft for the morning’s test flight. Beta, until now working in secret, has executed 175 of these so far. The plan for the 176th is to position the rotors 70 degrees up from horizontal, to gauge Ava’s stability during the transition from vertical to horizontal flight and back.\n\nThe Harvard-educated Clark created Beta in 2017, on the heels of multiple electronics and software startups. (The company name comes from his nickname in college—he was the nerdiest jock of the bunch, apparently.) Beta isn’t overly invested in the much-hyped air taxi market, though. “The goal of this aircraft was to elicit critical thinking about electric aviation,” says Clark, who paid for his pilot’s license with his hockey signing bonus. “The best way to do that was to build something. So we partnered with the company that became our launch customer to create this aircraft, and attempt to fly it across the country.” No better way, he figured, to expose the technical, logistical, and regulatory problems that populate a field now home to more than 130 companies, including Larry Page-funded Kitty Hawk, Airbus, Joby, and Bell.", {'entities': [(403, 412, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (1099, 1105, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (1352, 1369, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1972, 1992, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2026, 2033, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2039, 2051, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2100, 2114, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2186, 2196, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2327, 2330, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (2426, 2433, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2459, 2468, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2563, 2567, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2721, 2724, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (2840, 2844, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3019, 3023, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3607, 3617, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3619, 3625, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3627, 3631, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3637, 3641, 'UAM_COMPANY')]}), ('click to enlarge Thomas James\n\nThe future of human flight is soaring in a clear direction: electric aviation. That\'s the assertion of the experts at Beta Technologies, a South Burlington startup that\'s built what could be one of the most innovative aircraft ever to take to New England skies. Beta\'s eVTOL, or electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle, combines the flight characteristics of a helicopter, drone and fixed-wing airplane with cockpit and control systems that revolutionize the pilot\'s interface.\n\nSpoiler alert: That description of the experimental plane, which has already been built and test-flown at New York State\'s Plattsburgh International Airport, is all the company will reveal publicly before the craft\'s formal unveiling in 2019. That said, visitors to Beta\'s booth at this week\'s Vermont Tech Jam might get the opportunity to see a flight simulator and model cockpit.\n\nWhy is Beta\'s eVTOL in stealth mode? Not to protect trade secrets, said its developers. Currently, both the mainstream media and industry publications publish stories almost daily about eVTOL and electric aircraft, according to Beta\'s chief operating officer, Tom O\'Leary. Given that anticipation is already high, Beta leadership wants to focus on producing a finished product, not on giving tours and interviews.\n\nStill, questions abound: Is the plane being built for a commercial carrier? A cargo company? A car service such as Uber or Lyft? An air ambulance service? The company won\'t comment, except to say that the craft will be for civilian use and that the project is not funded by venture capital.\n\nBeta\'s experimental aircraft is the brainchild of company founder Kyle Clark. It\'s not the first Vermont startup for the 38-year-old engineer, inventor, pilot and entrepreneur. Among his previous projects was Designbook, which helped entrepreneurs launch, develop and crowdsource funding for their projects.\n\nClark is a motorcycle and aviation enthusiast who designs, builds, drives and flies experimental vehicles of all kinds. He\'s assembled an all-star team of electrical and mechanical engineers, software designers, and aviation industry experts to build this plane. Launched in the spring of 2017, the project went from initial concept to "wheels off the ground" in just 10 months, Clark said. That time trajectory is virtually unheard of in the aviation industry.\n\n"Everything we do is focused on rapid development," explained O\'Leary, who offered a reporter a peek into the company\'s headquarters in a Horizon Air hangar at Burlington International Airport. Like others on Beta\'s team, O\'Leary is a tech industry veteran; he previously was chief customer officer at Burlington\'s Dealer.com and, before that, general manager of sales at what was then Tesla Motors in Palo Alto, Calif.\n\nAfter walking past a half dozen conventional aircraft, we entered Beta\'s lab. There sat several scale models of the plane, a battery-charging station and a full-size wooden mockup of the cockpit, outfitted with a virtual reality headset. Clark was taking measurements on one of the scale models, which was about the size of a Ping-Pong table and resembled a huge balsa-wood model plane. Meanwhile, a 3D printer fabricated new parts for the flight deck.\n\nIn its effort to produce a viable electric aircraft, Beta\'s team shows sky-high ambition. This small Vermont-based startup, which just incorporated in July and has 21 full-time employees, aims to soar past other aerospace industry giants, including Boeing, Airbus, NASA and the U.S. military\'s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. All have been working on battery-powered airplanes for years and have poured tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars into the effort. Early prototypes have already been unveiled, though none is yet in mass production.\n\nWhat\'s the company\'s plan for success in that competitive environment? As O\'Leary pointed out, Toyota and General Motors had electric car programs in the works for years before Tesla became the electric car industry leader. As he put it, "We don\'t need to unlearn bad habits or ways of thinking about aviation."\n\nThe company can also take advantage of technology that didn\'t exist a decade ago, O\'Leary explained, which makes it possible to bring concepts rapidly from the drawing board to testing. Beta\'s designers can conceive of a new part in the morning, use CAD software to design it, send it to a 3D printer and implement it on a scale-model prototype the same afternoon.\n\n"Ten years ago," O\'Leary said, "that cycle would have taken us a month."\n\nConsider Beta\'s combined cockpit and flight deck. Beta hired a Vermont craftsman to build it out of wood in a few days, then plugged off-the-shelf electronics into it and installed other parts hot off the printer.\n\n"Now we have a feel for what this cockpit is going to look like," O\'Leary said. "We throw a VR headset on it, and all of a sudden we\'re experiencing flight in a matter of two months after we designed it."\n\nThe race to develop electric planes reflects a sense that the aviation industry\'s transition from fossil fuels is long overdue. According to the Environmental Defense Fund, aviation is one of the fastest-growing sources of global greenhouse gases, with the airline industry alone accounting for 2 to 3 percent of all human-created CO2 emissions. If the aerospace industry doesn\'t alter its current rate of fuel consumption, its greenhouse gas emissions are projected to triple by 2050.\n\nFor various reasons, electric-powered propulsion and control systems offer clear advantages over combustion engines, Clark said. The "energy density," or extractable energy, of current battery technology can\'t yet carry a full-size passenger plane from coast to coast, but it\'s getting there. Batteries\' power and energy efficiency are increasing at a rate of 5 percent per year, Clark said, while those of jet fuel engines have essentially "flatlined ... so the parity point is coming."\n\nElectric planes also will be cheaper to operate, Clark added. As of last week, jet fuel was selling for $5.64 per gallon at BTV. "That 429 out there," Clark said, referring to a Bell helicopter in the hangar, "will cost $3,600 an hour to operate. The aircraft we\'re developing ... will cost somewhere around $100 an hour."\n\nElectric motors offer other advantages over combustion engines, Clark continued. Because electric motors have fewer moving parts, they can go dramatically longer between component overhauls: A Beta aircraft can go about 10,000 hours; a conventional helicopter, only 1,000 to 3,000.\n\nAnd electric aircraft are safer. Without hundreds of gallons of jet fuel on board, a plane is far less likely to catch fire in a crash.\n\nElectric motors excite Clark for another reason: They\'ve enabled him to build a "fly-by-wire" system that operates the plane with wired, and even wireless, controls, eliminating the need for mechanical moving parts.\n\nWhen Clark was getting his bachelor\'s degree at Harvard University, he was awarded the 2004 Engineering Thesis of the Year for his work on flight dynamics and control algorithms. The control systems in Beta\'s aircraft, which he\'s been imagining for 15 years, allow the pilot to operate the plane more intuitively, such as by leaning in one direction or another to steer, bank and climb.\n\nSo, has he flown it yet?\n\n"Oh, yeah!" Clark said with a huge smile. "That\'s the grin."\n\nClark\'s contagious enthusiasm for the project has attracted senior tech industry veterans from Vermont and beyond. Steve Arms is founder of what\'s now LORD Sensing-MicroStrain in Williston, which builds sensors used in everything from bridges to robotics to helicopters. Arms, who sold his company to LORD in 2012, heard about Clark\'s project via word of mouth and joined the team in November 2017. He\'s now using sensing technologies and software developed at MicroStrain on Beta\'s aircraft.\n\nArms, one of four former MicroStrain people who\'ve joined Beta, described Clark as "indefatigable" and a "roll-up-your-sleeves-and-get-it-done" kind of guy. "Kyle can manage so many things at the same time [and] makes it look easy," Arms said. "It\'s wonderful and very inspiring to the team."\n\nAnother key hire was Artur Adib, a well-known name in Silicon Valley, who was a senior software developer at Twitter and Mozilla and a researcher at New Mexico\'s Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n\nAdib said he\'s actually found it advantageous to work in Vermont rather than Silicon Valley. "You avoid thinking like they do," he said. "If you\'re constantly surrounded by the same people talking about the same things all the time, there\'s a lot of groupthink that goes on. We don\'t have that here."\n\nAdib cited another advantage to being headquartered in Vermont: easier access to the state\'s congressional delegation, the airport\'s leadership and, by extension, its Federal Aviation Administration staff. All of them, he noted, have been extremely supportive of this project.\n\nBoth Adib and Arms pointed to a perk of working at Beta: Because all of the team members need to understand the language, mechanics and physics of flight, Clark hired local flight instructors to train them to become licensed pilots. That\'s a new skill for Arms, though he used to fly with his father in the 1970s and \'80s. Climbing aboard the Cessna 172 trainer, he said, was "like stepping into a time machine. It looked like my dad\'s plane and even smelled like his plane."\n\nVermonters won\'t get a look at Beta\'s new aircraft until next year, but O\'Leary insisted it will be worth the wait.\n\n"Electric aviation is the inevitable future. It\'s going to happen gradually over the next five to 50 years, beginning with short flights," he said. "This is an international business opportunity where a small company in Vermont can compete on the same playing field with the big boys."', {'entities': [(149, 166, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (293, 297, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (639, 672, 'INFRASTRUCTURE'), (782, 786, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (906, 910, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1127, 1131, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1213, 1217, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1606, 1610, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2516, 2534, 'INFRASTRUCTURE'), (2538, 2570, 'INFRASTRUCTURE'), (2587, 2591, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2865, 2869, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3199, 3209, 'TECHNOLOGY'), (3306, 3310, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3502, 3508, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3510, 3516, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3518, 3522, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (3547, 3588, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (4314, 4318, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (4378, 4381, 'TECHNOLOGY'), (4418, 4428, 'TECHNOLOGY'), (4577, 4581, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (4618, 4622, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (5134, 5160, 'PROGRAM'), (6273, 6285, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (6482, 6486, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (6509, 6521, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (6790, 6801, 'TECHNOLOGY'), (7128, 7132, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (7553, 7565, 'SUPPLIER'), (7566, 7577, 'SUPPLIER'), (7703, 7707, 'SUPPLIER'), (7863, 7874, 'SUPPLIER'), (7878, 7882, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (7921, 7932, 'SUPPLIER'), (7954, 7958, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (8854, 8885, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (9016, 9020, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (9473, 9477, 'UAM_COMPANY')]}), ('Update: This story has been updated to reflect that the participants in the FLIGHT VT program will be selected by several local organizations that work with youth and young adults.\n\nVermont Flight Academy has launched FLIGHT VT, an initiative to provide local youth the opportunity to fly an airplane, the nonprofit said in a news release.\n\nThe Flight Academy is partnering with BETA Technologies and Burlington International Airport to train as many as 100 young people, ages 12-22, to fly planes over their hometowns this year.

Photo by Eric Adams.\n\nMore tantalizingly, perhaps, the technology will also see some application in passenger transportation.\n\nEVTOL aircraft will not be replacing Boeing and Airbus jumbo jets anytime soon, but, Clark said, “I believe that between 2026 and 2030 we would start to see the bulk of air taxis using electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing aircraft.”\n\nIn addition to its facilities in Vermont, Beta leases a 40,000-square-foot hangar at Plattsburgh International Airport, where it has conducted the bulk of test flights for its prototype, named Alia.\n\n[Alia gets a helicopter airlift across Lake Champlain, rather than flying on its own propulsion.]\n\nIn a January 19 interview, Clark said that Beta's payroll stood at 177.\n\nIncorporated in 2017, Beta is also increasing its footprint at BTV.\n\nThe company has just completed a 14,000-square-foot addition on its hangar there.\n\nFurther, Clark reported, “We just got permitted for a 22,000-square-foot addition we're building on the north side of the same hangar, towards the main terminal.”\n\nHe also expected expansion at the leased Williston facility, which has been producing recharging systems.\n\n“We put just under one million in leasehold improvements to the facility for our production,” he noted. “We expect to be there indefinitely.”\n\nThe plant will also produce unmanned small aircraft that, he said, are “just a little bit smaller and have a different purpose [from the eVTOL]. But that's not our chief focus.”\n\nPhoto: Beta recharging site at night. Photo by Eric Adams.\n\nThe Virtues of Simplicity\n\nFunding for the eVTOL's development is coming largely from United Therapeutics, a pharmaceutical and biotech firm based in Maryland and North Carolina.\n\nThe mission of UT's Organ Manufacturing Group, according to its website, is “to manufacture an unlimited supply of transplantable organs before the end of the decade.”\n\nThat will include both modified organs from pigs and organs constructed in part with 3-D printers.\n\nThe high-tech printers also constitute part of operations at Beta, where they turn out “a whole lot of cooling components for electric motors, as well as airfoils and molds for carbon fiber parts,” said Clark, who grew up in Chittenden County and went on to a degree in engineering at Harvard.\n\nWhatever the reliance on space-age manufacturing techniques, however, the engineer-entrepreneur sees design simplicity as a virtue.\n\nAlia uses a direct-drive system to power its propeller and rotors. That means essentially that no gearing modifies the engine's power before it gets to the propeller or rotor.\n\nThe design makes Alia – which vaguely resembles a small helicopter – lightweight and more reliable, unburdened as it is by additional failure-prone mechanical components.\n\nPhoto: Alia in the air.

It maintains forward momentum at all times, even during takeoff and landing.\n\nEach of the four “corners” of the aircraft – which weighs only two to three tons – houses a motor to drive the vertical-lift rotors that get the craft off the ground.\n\nSince the motors can run at different speeds, the rotors spin correspondingly, as the circumstances demand. That removes the need for a differential distribution of torque generated by a single motor – again simplifying the overall design of the craft.\n\nIt has a range of 288 miles.\n\nClark pointed to three major advantages that Beta's product will have over today's aircraft.\n\nFirst, there's the obvious plus of eliminating fossil fuels and thus reducing operational emissions to zero.\n\nThat, he stressed, “is a big, important factor for many businesses that have fleets of aircraft.”\n\nHe also noted the reduction in maintenance – which, he said, is “massively improved by cold propulsion.”\n\nThen there's operational flexibility, too.\n\n“You can go directly to the hospital or distribution facility,” he explained. “No one likes going to the airport.”\n\n“All those organs have to be transported.”\n\nAlia is the successor to Beta's Ava prototype, which Clark described as a proof-of-concept vehicle.\n\n“It showed that we could fly a distributed-propulsion, all electric, VTOL aircraft... When we successfully did that, we earned a $48 million contract from UT to design a new aircraft, Alia, and we've actually built two of them now.”\n\nUT has also purchased a number of the recharging stations Beta makes in Williston.\n\n“We have a similarly sized contract from the Air Force, and we have two other contracts that I unfortunately can't talk about. And then we have local investors that have put about $53 million into the company while we develop the aircraft.”\n\nHe anticipated getting Federal Aviation Administration certification for Alia.\n\n“It'll be about a two-and-a-half- to three-year process, that we've already started, to understand what modifications or changes will be needed for them to accept it. So far it appears that the baseline design is certifiable. It is stable and flies well.”\n\n“We anticipate being able to sell [Alia] to the Air Force in 2022, and to our other customers starting in 2024… The Air Force has a different path to certification, which is a little less friction. It will lead into deploying squadrons of aircraft in 2023.”\n\nHe said he expected UT to start flying Alia “between 2025 and 2026. They have anchored on having 60 aircraft deployed in 2026, and 100 aircraft deployed yearly from 2027 onward.”\n\nWhen VBM expressed surprise at the size of the UT commitment, he noted that thousands of people in the United States die each year while waiting for transplants – about 20 people a day, according to the American Transplant Foundation.\n\nAnywhere from 108 to 120 thousand individuals are waiting for organ transplants at any one time, according to online sources.\n\nAccording to the United Network for Organ Sharing, about 40,000 transplants are done nationwide each year, meaning that many thousands wind up waiting – and maybe dying.\n\n“All those organs have to be transported,” Clark pointed out that it’s the weak link in the transplant process.\n\nNo Public Demonstration Flight - Yet\n\nBeta faces plenty of competition.\n\nUber, for example, is touting its Uber Elevate program, which “is developing shared air transportation—planned for 2023—between suburbs and cities, and ultimately within cities. We’re working with our Elevate Network partners to launch fleets of small, electric VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft in Dallas, Los Angeles, and Melbourne,” Uber's website reports under the headline “The future of urban mobility.”\n\nWhether the business model will be relevant to a rural state like Vermont, or to applications Clark foresees for Alia, is unclear.\n\n“Each of the major aerospace companies has a program,” Clark said. “We're one of four companies that have flying prototypes, and to my knowledge we're the only company that has meaningful contracts for the use of the aircraft.”\n\nBut – VBM asked the obvious question – what of air traffic control, once all those eVTOLs join the array of other flying devices in what once was the exclusive province of birds?\n\n“As the traffic density increases, so will the technology that enables less aircraft separation,” he said. “Both NASA and the FAA have meaningful programs focused on this.”\n\nBut while aircraft like Alia show great potential, those who foresee electric aircraft sidelining today's jetliners need a reality check.\n\n“There's a physical limit to what you can do in a VTOL aircraft with this technology,” Clark said. “We have the biggest aircraft in this space right now,” he added.\n\nHe anticipated building eVTOL craft with a capacity of “six passengers, maybe up to nine. The problem is you hit regulatory limits pretty quickly. We're not crossing that bridge yet.”\n\nAsked whether eVTOLs will be chargeable at home, much as electric cars are, he likewise expressed some caution.\n\n“Ultimately, yes. We have small chargers in the lab right now, on 240-volt circuits, but it would take a day to charge [the plane] up.”\n\nWhile a 2019 article on thedrive.com spoke of an “upcoming cross-country flight” to demonstrate the capabilities of Beta's aircraft, such plans have not yet materialized.\n\n“We've done demonstrations ... for our customers,” Clark said. “We haven't done any public demonstration flights.”\n\nAsked when the general public might get a view of Beta's product in action, he said, “Obviously with COVID and everything ... it's an awkward world right now, so I don't know when.”\n\nIt can be safely said, though, that a great many people in Vermont and elsewhere are eager to see what Beta's technology will produce.\n\nCB Hall is a freelance writer from Southern Vermont.", {'entities': [(7, 11, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (648, 680, 'INFRASTRUCTURE'), (722, 739, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (894, 898, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1100, 1104, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1255, 1267, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (1561, 1582, 'DEADLINE'), (1725, 1729, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1768, 1801, 'INFRASTRUCTURE'), (1876, 1880, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (1884, 1888, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (2025, 2029, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2077, 2081, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2807, 2811, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2946, 2965, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (3055, 3085, 'SUPPLIER'), (3370, 3374, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3737, 3741, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (3931, 3935, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (4093, 4097, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (4179, 4183, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (4717, 4726, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (4774, 4778, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (5342, 5346, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (5367, 5371, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (5374, 5377, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (5573, 5592, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (5598, 5600, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (5627, 5631, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (5677, 5679, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (5735, 5739, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (5806, 5815, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (6026, 6057, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (6076, 6080, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (6375, 6379, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (6388, 6397, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (6401, 6405, 'DEADLINE'), (6446, 6450, 'DEADLINE'), (6456, 6465, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (6591, 6595, 'DEADLINE'), (6619, 6621, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (6638, 6642, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (6644, 6665, 'DEADLINE'), (6720, 6724, 'DEADLINE'), (6764, 6775, 'DEADLINE'), (6826, 6828, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (7464, 7468, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (7533, 7545, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (7614, 7618, 'DEADLINE'), (7700, 7715, 'PROGRAM'), (8034, 8038, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (8575, 8579, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (8588, 8591, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (8660, 8664, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (8997, 9011, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (9492, 9496, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (9714, 9718, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (9950, 9954, 'UAM_COMPANY')]}), ('Founded in 2017, BETA and its team of aerospace engineers are building an electric powered ecosystem for aviation, the heart of which is ALIA, the electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft that can carry up to six people or three standard cargo pallets. BETA\'s emphasis on simplicity, efficiency and sustainability has led to a pioneering electric aircraft design and the world\'s largest aircraft charging network. BETA\'s customers are in the key aerospace markets of Logistics, Medical, Defense and, now, Passenger.\n\n"Blade is flying people in and out of cities every day, and we\'re excited to partner together with the leader in UAM to create a new paradigm in passenger aviation," said Kyle Clark, BETA\'s founder and CEO. "BETA is a pragmatic company building pragmatic aircraft. It\'s clear that the simplicity of our approach, strength of our technology, consistent progress against our timelines as well as the expertise of our team resonates with the best operators in the world. We are extremely excited to partner with Blade and serve the passenger mission"\n\nBlade founder and CEO Rob Wiesenthal said, "Blade is laser-focused on its transition from conventional rotorcraft to Electric Vertical Aircraft. The ALIA\'s extremely low sound footprint coupled with its zero emissions design will enable us to reduce the noise and environmental impact to the communities surrounding the existing heliport and airport infrastructure we currently use. ALIA is a full-scale EVA flying in piloted configuration almost every day. The team\'s progress is formidable. BETA\'s scheduled delivery beginning in 2024 is ahead of our current projected deployment of EVA in 2025. The transaction, consistent with our asset-light operating model, allows Blade to leverage our significant flight volumes and third-party financing relationships to support the purchase of BETA aircraft by our operator partners."\n\nExpanding Customer Base\n\nWith today\'s news, Blade Urban Air Mobility becomes BETA\'s first passenger service partner, securing up to 20 of the first passenger-configured ALIA EVAs for purchase by its network of operators and third-party financing partners, with delivery scheduled to begin in late 2024. BETA\'s ALIA aircraft will have a 250 nautical mile range with a cruising speed of up to 170 miles per hour. Blade\'s service with ALIA will begin on select routes using Blade\'s existing private terminal infrastructure. These aircraft will be deployed for a diverse set of mission profiles to and from city centers across multiple geographies.\n\nIn addition to today\'s passenger service news, BETA\'s technological capability across commercial, defense and cargo applications has been validated by a diverse customer mix.\n\nBETA\'s first customer and partner, United Therapeutics, will rely on BETA\'s aircraft to deliver organs for human transplantation.\n\nLast week, UPS announced it reserved the right to purchase 150 of BETA\'s aircraft, with the first 10 to be delivered beginning in 2024. UPS also purchased BETA\'s charging stations as part of an integrated solution.\n\nThe United States Air Force continues to participate in the BETA flight test campaigns as a part of its innovative USAF Agility Prime program, which marshals government resources to accelerate commercialization of air mobility vehicles.\n\nALIA: Simple, Clean, Quiet\n\nBETA\'s ALIA aircraft includes a novel combination of elements that create a smooth, quiet flying experience, with applications for moving both people and cargo, all while producing zero operational emissions. ALIA will be capable of flying 250 nautical miles on a single charge and carrying six people or three standard cargo pallets and a pilot. Charging will be completed in less than 50 minutes. While flying, the aircraft will be more than 10x quieter than a helicopter, imperceptible over normal urban noise and quieter than cars on a highway.\n\nBETA\'s Commitment to Sustainability and an Electric Aviation Ecosystem\n\nThe aviation industry currently accounts for nine percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and is forecasted to account for the majority by 2035 if companies like BETA don\'t make a meaningful dent in aircraft emissions. With Blade and others in the transportation and logistics companies pledging to reach net zero emissions within the next 20 years, BETA\'s aircraft offer a clear path to achieving these goals.\n\nBETA is focused on sustainability. The Company is building not only a zero operational emissions aircraft, but a full electric powered aviation ecosystem.\n\nBETA has the largest aviation charging network in the world, extending throughout the northeast United States , and sites are underway across America, with plans to expand it rapidly. These high-speed charging stations allow aircraft to charge at airports, or land on an elevated deck and charge while crew and passengers access a lounge below, complete with work space and sleeping accommodations. Recharging takes less than an hour and can be accomplished in both on- and off-airport locations.\n\n, and sites are underway across America, with plans to expand it rapidly.

Recharging takes less than an hour and can be accomplished in both on- and off-airport locations. BETA has developed immersive flight simulators, located in Burlington, VT , Washington, D.C. and Springfield, OH , and a curriculum to train pilots on electric powered aircraft, to match an anticipated surge in demand.\n\nAbout BETA\n\nBETA has built a strikingly simple Electric Vertical Aircraft ("EVA") platform with a direct path to Part 23 FAA certification. Pragmatism motivates BETA\'s emphasis on simplicity. The Company\'s first goal is safety, ALIA is serviced by elegant redundancy, appropriate diversity of implementation and simplicity of control. ALIA is an inherently stable aircraft with fixed pitch propellers and centralized batteries.\n\nThe team powering BETA\'s progress is deep and experienced. Clark, BETA\'s founder, has accumulated hundreds of flight hours in over 250 EVA flights. As a company, BETA has completed a comprehensive full-scale, all electric and manned flight test campaign. BETA\'s team consists of engineers who have worked at some of the world\'s leading technology companies and organizations including the Federal Aviation Administration, Boeing, Tesla, SpaceX, Lockheed Martin and General Electric.\n\nAbout Blade\n\nBlade Urban Air Mobility ("Blade") is a technology-powered urban air mobility platform committed to reducing travel friction by providing cost-effective air transportation alternatives to some of the most congested ground routes in the U.S. and abroad. Today, the company predominantly uses helicopters and amphibious aircraft. Its asset-light model, coupled with its exclusive passenger terminal infrastructure, is designed to facilitate a seamless transition to Electric Vertical Aircraft ("EVA" or "eVTOL", as referred to by industry), enabling lower cost air mobility to the public that is both quiet and zero emissions.\n\nBlade recently announced it would become a public company via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Experience Investment Corp. (NASDAQ: EXPC). Closing of the merger is subject to approval by the stockholders of both Blade and Experience Investment Corp. and the satisfaction or waiver of certain other conditions.\n\nFor more information, visit www.blade.com .\n\nSOURCE BETA Technologies\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttps://www.beta.team/\n\n', {'entities': [(17, 21, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (137, 141, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (259, 263, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (420, 424, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (524, 529, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (706, 710, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (731, 735, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1032, 1037, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (1072, 1077, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (1116, 1121, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (1221, 1225, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (1455, 1459, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (1565, 1569, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1591, 1608, 'DEADLINE'), (1664, 1668, 'DEADLINE'), (1743, 1748, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (1859, 1863, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1945, 1969, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (1978, 1982, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2070, 2074, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (2184, 2202, 'DEADLINE'), (2204, 2208, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2211, 2215, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (2237, 2260, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2292, 2310, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2312, 2317, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (2333, 2337, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (2372, 2377, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (2594, 2598, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2723, 2727, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2758, 2777, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (2792, 2796, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2865, 2868, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (2920, 2924, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2971, 2988, 'DEADLINE'), (2990, 2993, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (3009, 3013, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3074, 3097, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (3130, 3134, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3185, 3211, 'PROGRAM'), (3308, 3312, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (3336, 3340, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3343, 3347, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (3545, 3549, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (3576, 3594, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (3713, 3733, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (3780, 3791, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (3886, 3890, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (4098, 4105, 'DEADLINE'), (4124, 4128, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (4186, 4191, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (4312, 4316, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (4374, 4378, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (4530, 4534, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (5415, 5419, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (5641, 5645, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (5647, 5651, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (5748, 5773, 'REGULATION'), (5796, 5800, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (5863, 5867, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (5970, 5974, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (6082, 6086, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (6130, 6134, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (6226, 6230, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (6319, 6323, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (6453, 6484, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (6486, 6492, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (6554, 6559, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (6561, 6566, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (6588, 6593, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (7187, 7192, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (7416, 7421, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (7567, 7571, 'UAM_COMPANY')]})]
