VALID_DATA = [('Air-taxi startup Beta Technologies debuted its new aircraft Friday with a dramatic helicopter airlift of the sleek white model across Lake Champlain from Burlington, Vermont, to Plattsburgh, New York. Code-named Alia, the electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing (eVTOL) airplane is the successor to Ava, a smaller prototype the company used to experiment with propulsion strategies and learn about the tricky aerodynamics of small, electrified, vertical-lift flight.\n\nAccording to company founder Kyle Clark, Alia’s striking configuration and elegant shape owes a debt to the longest-migrating bird in the world, the Arctic tern. This includes a twin-tail assembly supported by angled trusses, dramatically arched wings, and arcing, tapered wingtips. The tern’s tail configuration and wing stance “proved a great baseline to start from,” Clark says.\n\nFor the tern, those features enable ultraefficient, long range flights. Beta hopes for similar performance. Its primary client, United Therapeutics, is developing man-made organs for human transplant and intends to use Beta’s aircraft as an efficient, environmentally friendly distribution system.\n\nBeta didn’t release performance specifications, except to say that it aims to build a prototype that can fly 250 miles and charge in under an hour. Alia has a 50-foot wingspan, and will have a takeoff weight of 6,000 pounds—the prototype airlifted in Vermont on Friday weighed 3,800 pounds, having been stripped of batteries and other heavy components. The craft uses four horizontally mounted rotors for vertical lift and a single rear-facing propeller to boost speed in forward flight. The wide wings will generate lift for more efficient forward flight, instead of relying on the motors to do all of the work as in eVTOL aircraft that derive most of their lift from rotors. It will use existing battery technology and be deployed as part of an ecosystem that includes charging stations in urban centers, at hospitals, or in remote locations to extend the aircraft’s range.\n\nBeyond transporting organs, Beta hopes to expand to commercial applications, cargo, and passenger-carrying air taxis. It is one of two companies, along with Joby Aviation, recently selected by the US Air Force to advance to the next stage of development in its Agility Prime eVTOL program.\n\nThe aircraft’s unusual shape will raise eyebrows, but its propulsion strategy is likely to raise even more—in the eVTOL aviation community, anyway. Many eVTOL developers use tilt-rotor systems in which multiple rotors point skyward for takeoff and landing then pitch forward for horizontal flight. Beta used that strategy for Ava, but it proved too complex for the engineers to want to deploy it in a production aircraft. “Our primary objective is to meet our first customer’s mission, reliable organ delivery when and where it’s needed,” Clark says. “We couldn’t have an aircraft that had any possibility of being grounded for repairs due to a complex system.”\n\nInstead of tilt-rotors, Alia uses four fixed rotors on the top of the aircraft and a pusher-prop in the rear to speed forward flight. This strategy required the development of new, ultra-efficient rotors, but they could be optimized for just one job—vertical flight—rather than two. This simplicity will not only make the aircraft more reliable, Beta contends, but also easier to certify and more affordable, because it will have fewer parts, compared with tilt-rotor systems, and lower maintenance costs.', {'entities': [(17, 34, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (212, 216, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (297, 300, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (507, 511, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (921, 925, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (977, 996, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (1068, 1072, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1148, 1152, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1253, 1266, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (1271, 1294, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (1296, 1300, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (1307, 1323, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (1359, 1371, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (1417, 1437, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2053, 2057, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2182, 2195, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2222, 2234, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (2286, 2313, 'PROGRAM'), (2614, 2618, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2642, 2645, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (3003, 3007, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (3325, 3329, 'UAM_COMPANY')]}), ('Vermont-based eVTOL developer Beta Technologies hasn’t announced a billion-dollar IPO or coughed up any non-binding agreements to build bustling vertiports in global cities, but it has flown its fully electric airplane between two separate airports. In reality, that’s a much bigger deal.\n\nBeta Technologies’ Alia in flight above Lake Champlain on March 16. Eric Adams Photo\n\nThe achievement on Wednesday, in which Beta’s Alia-250 prototype made a flight from its primary test location in Plattsburgh, New York, across Lake Champlain to the company’s headquarters in nearby Burlington, Vermont, has practical significance in addition to being a meaningful moment for the company’s nearly 200 engineers, designers, fabricators, and other team members. The Federal Aviation Administration doesn’t allow experimental aircraft to fly beyond their base airports until they’re proven stable enough to do so, so Wednesday’s mission represents that achievement and a closing of the initial phase of flight test.\n\nIn order to qualify for the multi-airport flight, executed by test pilot Camron “Arlo” Guthrie, who climbed to 8,000 feet before crossing the lake in sunny, chilly early-morning conditions, Beta had to validate Alia’s reliable and predictable behavior during takeoffs and landings, but also its stall characteristics, upset recovery abilities, glide performance, and controllability across other key phases of flight.\n\nCompany founder, CEO, and chief test pilot Kyle Clark said that the company added its own requirements along the way. Beta airlifted Alia to Plattsburgh last June after several months of tethered hover tests and began a rigorous flight test program in New York. The engineers validated the lift-over-drag ratio and the propulsion system’s thrust-to-weight ratio, conducted taxi tests, and studied how the aircraft handles at or near the stall point, Clark said.\n\n“That’s really important because you have to come near that every time you transition onto the rotors for vertical flight,” he said.\n\nIn accordance with Beta’s test philosophy, the plan was to first hover the aircraft, then go fly it solely in conventional forward flight, nudging it toward the slowest possible flight on the fixed wing, and then move back to hover testing as they progress toward full eVTOL transitions.\n\n“We’ve painted the ends of the envelope now and brought the fixed wing back to the slow condition,” Clark said. “Now it’s time to bring Alia back to our research and development center here in Vermont.”\n\nProduction versions of Alia will enter service first in commercial, industrial, and military applications — as a cargo, utility, and transport aircraft — before moving into the consumer air taxi realm. Alia will now travel back and forth between the two airports occasionally as testing continues and within a few weeks have its top rotors reinstalled for vertical flight tests.\n\nAlia makes the flight from Plattsburgh, New York, to the company’s headquarters in Burlington, Vermont, one of many milestone test flights in recent weeks. Eric Adams Photo\n\nThis week’s milestone comes with a variety of other recent achievements for the company. Not only did Alia reach 8,000 feet altitude during recent flights, it also set a new personal-best in range — a number the company isn’t ready to disclose at this time. (The straight-line distance between Plattsburgh and Burlington is only 18 miles/29 kilometers, but the flight involved a steady circular climb to 8,000 feet before crossing, then an orbit above Burlington International Airport. The mission was easily completed with just three battery packs installed, of five possible, and took 50 minutes.)\n\nBeta expects Alia to have a maximum range of 250 miles (400 km), including a vertical takeoff and a vertical landing.\n\nBeta is also nearing completion of its second composite-built prototype and it recently joined a handful of eVTOL manufacturers to be admitted to the General Aviation Manufacturer’s Association. Clark noted that this is in response to the eVTOL movement’s focus on commercializing the aircraft, which GAMA supports.\n\nWhile flight test is the largest part of the company’s daily operations, it’s also working hard on what Clark calls its “ground game” — the development and installation of charging stations that will allow the company’s aircraft to begin cross-country flights.\n\n“We just completed our network that goes from here in Vermont, across the top of New York, across the top Pennsylvania, and all the way down into Ohio to near Wright Patterson Air Force Base,” he said. “So we’ve completed that network, and we have now a facility at the Springfield, Ohio, airport with a full immersive simulator for the Air Force.”\n\nThis is in support of the Air Force’s Agility Prime initiative, which the branch is using to help ensure that the next generation of aerospace technologies grow in the United States rather than abroad. Beta has set up a similar simulator and charging pad near Washington, D.C.\n\nClark said pursuing all these channels helps make the new technology commercially viable.\n\n“Describing the air taxi market in detail, with passengers coming into vertiports that are 18 stories tall, is very understandable, but it’s not the problem that needs to be solved today,” he added. “There’s still nobody who has certified or is commercially operating an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, so the problem that does need to be solved today is to make intensely reliable propulsion systems and put them into really smart aircraft configurations. That’s what we’re focused on.”', {'entities': [(30, 47, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (290, 307, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (309, 313, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (415, 419, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (422, 430, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (755, 786, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (1105, 1126, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (1195, 1199, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1216, 1220, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (1542, 1546, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (1557, 1561, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (2040, 2044, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2446, 2450, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (2537, 2541, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (2716, 2720, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (2894, 2898, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (3170, 3174, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (3181, 3191, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (3472, 3482, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (3520, 3552, 'INFRASTRUCTURE'), (3669, 3673, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3682, 3686, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (3714, 3723, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (3725, 3731, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (3788, 3792, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3938, 3981, 'ASSOCIATION'), (4089, 4093, 'ASSOCIATION'), (4526, 4557, 'INFRASTRUCTURE'), (4704, 4713, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (4743, 4752, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (4755, 4768, 'PROGRAM'), (4919, 4923, 'UAM_COMPANY')]}), ('• CAE and BETA to partner and create best in class training program for the ALIA Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing Aircraft (eVTOL) • BETA Technologies is an industry leader in Advanced Air Mobility with forward purchase orders from UPS Flight Forward, United Therapeutics & Blade for ALIA eVTOL Aircraft and supporting charging infrastructure\n\nCAE announced today that BETA Technologies (BETA) selected CAE as its partner of choice to design and develop its pilot and maintenance technician training program for the ALIA eVTOL aircraft.

Both are Williston Central School-educated, both are captivated by aviation and both are bullish on electric-powered flight.\n\nBeta Technologies is developing electric airplanes out of its headquarters at Burlington International Airport and two manufacturing facilities on Avenue D in Williston. Wayman reached out to the company as part of his “Genius Hour” project on electric planes in Joy Peterson and Jared Bailey’s humanities class at Williston Central.\n\nThe company, fresh off an eye-popping ($368 million) investment announcement from Amazon and Fidelity, presented Wayman an unforgettable offer: spend a day at the airport, flying in a helicopter piloted by former Obama Administration Marine One pilot Nick Warren, testing out a flight simulator, meeting engineers and pilots and touring a model electric plane lab. Wayman’s day at Beta was this Wednesday. On June 11, the company plans a flyover above Williston Central School as part of the students’ Genius Hour open house.\n\n“This is my dream come true,” Wayman said Tuesday. “It’s really exciting. I’m going to learn a lot. It’s going to be really fun.”\n\nKatie Clark, who works in community outreach and communications for the company, hears echoes of CEO Kyle Clark (her husband) in Wayman’s enthusiasm.\n\nKyle Clark grew up in Williston and went to WCS until his eighth-grade year, when he moved to Essex. He graduated from Essex High School — where he met Katie — and went on to study math and engineering at Harvard. According to Katie, Kyle used a signing bonus from the Washington Capitals where he had signed on to play professional hockey in the NHL, to instead enroll in flight school and become a licensed pilot.\n\n“Jonah sounds a lot like Kyle did when he was a kid,” Katie said. “His passion for aviation goes back as long as he can remember.

This 4,000-pound, eight-motor, eight-propeller battery-operated e-VTOL aircraft has been in secret development for two years, but was revealed to The Drive during a visit last week. The aircraft uses those eight rotors to allow vertical takeoffs and landing by pointing them 90 degrees up; when pivoted forward, they provide thrust while the 35-foot wing generates lift. The aircraft sits high on tall landing gear, which provide the ground clearance necessary when the propellers pitch forward. It is so far the heaviest known e-VTOL to fly, with more than 170 tests under its belt to date.\n\nEric Adams\n\nNot only did the company come out of stealth mode this week, but it revealed its funding source and an ambitious demonstration scheduled for this spring or summer. Though the amount invested in Beta remains secret, Clark revealed that his company is funded by United Therapeutics, which is developing manufactured organs for human transplant. Led by technology entrepreneur Martine Rothblatt, founder of SiriusXM satellite radio, the company expects to begin manufacturing its organs around 2024–about the same time that Clark says the production version of his aircraft will be ready.\n\nEric Adams\n\nRothblatt sees e-VTOL as the most efficient and economical way to transport organs on-demand. The technology is very close to ready, she said, with battery capacity improving annually. “We’ve seen seven percent improvements in energy density every year for the past several decades,” she said. “We need 300 watt-hours per kilogram in order to reach a range of 250 nautical miles, which is what I’m asking for, and it’s a no-brainer to see that we’ll be there in just a few years.”\n\nEric Adams\n\nClark—who's no stranger to Vermont's chill, having once played minor league ice hockey—began his quest even before meeting up with Rothblatt, through work dating back to his college days at Harvard and stretching through a variety of engineering and software startups across the last 15 years. He committed to building Ava when Beta formed in 2017, as a way of “opening up a conversation” about electric aviation. The plan was to fly the aircraft across the country as a way of exposing all the challenges and associated with the work, from performance to regulatory to practical matters such as charging. He assembled a team that included veterans of GE Global Research, Scaled Composites, Tesla, and multiple technology and engineering firms. He even struck up a friendship with Segway inventor Dean Kamen that saw the latter become one of Beta’s key advisors. Now, the vision is all coming together in Burlington and across the lake in Plattsburgh. During several tests last week, Clark flew Ava up and down the 12,000-foot runway, with chase vehicles in hot pursuit. It flew confidently and capably—and much more quietly than I expected. It’s no turbine-powered chopper, but a serene, steady flying machine.\n\nEric Adams\n\nAt the moment it appears that Beta is a solid front-runner in the race to e-VTOL glory—though other companies are being as secretive as Beta previously was about their own status. Though the development of the final production aircraft will focus on the specific needs of Rothblatt’s work, Clark is free to also pursue the air-taxi market with his aircraft, as it could easily serve both roles.\n\nEric Adams\n\nRegardless of the many specific potential uses, he’s passionate about the simple advantages brought by electric aviation. The biggest is reliability: “With many fewer moving parts running at much lower temperatures, electric motors will go for three to 10 times longer before requiring an overhaul,” he said. Another is efficiency. Internal combustion aircraft operate at between 20 and 30 percent efficiency, while electric motors reach 90 to 99 percent efficiency, meaning they can be operated far more economically without emitting any pollution from the aircraft itself. Finally, there’s the pure performance advantage. “Electric motors put out a constant torque across all speeds,” Clark said. “This enables them to be used in a distributed propulsion configuration where the flight controller can demand and expect instantaneous thrust adjustments at any power level.”\n\nEric Adams\n\nThe result: Ultra-precise control no matter the speed or attitude. In fact, e-VTOL aircraft could safely cut power completely—such as to avoid a collision—go into freefall, then restart and recover before hitting the ground. Though such a capability is unlikely to ever be used, as the air-taxi market takes off and similar aircraft enter the skies by the thousands in coming decades, it’ll be a good trick for one to have up the sleeve—just in case.\n\nEric Adams\n\nThe upcoming cross-country flight is meant as both a discovery process—to learn about the capabilities and uncover unknowns—and a demonstration of the technology. To pull it off, Beta will rely on one additional piece of very cool hardware in the hangar: a 1982 Eagle bus. Formerly a musician’s touring vehicle, Clark converted it to a mobile charging platform for Ava. It now has batteries, solar panels, and generators, as well as an expandable landing pad on the roof. Inside, there are bunks and a lounge area for team members to track the flights and troubleshoot along the way.\n\nEric Adams\n\nAround the time of the cross-country journey, Clark will also reveal the final configuration of the production version. Don't expect it to look like Ava, though: It will be completely different from her set-up, as well as faster and capable of flying much further, up to 290 miles—with no bus necessary.", {'entities': [(263, 280, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (361, 378, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (604, 616, 'TECHNOLOGY'), (740, 744, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (861, 868, 'TECHNOLOGY'), (1135, 1139, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2028, 2061, 'INFRASTRUCTURE'), (2071, 2097, 'INFRASTRUCTURE'), (2152, 2158, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (2165, 2176, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2178, 2189, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2191, 2206, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2435, 2448, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2502, 2514, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2959, 2963, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (3025, 3044, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (4177, 4180, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (4186, 4190, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (4700, 4704, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (4853, 4856, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (5113, 5117, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (5219, 5223, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (7022, 7026, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (7208, 7211, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (7589, 7592, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (7705, 7720, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE')]}), ('Courtesy Of Brian Jenkins/Beta Technologies\n\nThe Alia aircraft\n\nYou can\'t not see the planes. Beta Technologies\' two prized prototypes take up the center of its bustling headquarters inside a hangar at Burlington International Airport. Around the upper rim of the airy space, employee workstations overlook the lustrous white machines through long walls of glass. During a recent tour, a group of engineers studied aircraft designs on a projection screen in one conference room. Next door, two others played Ping-Pong.\n\nThe open office layout isn\'t to imitate Silicon Valley, or even to show off Beta\'s aircraft, founder and CEO Kyle Clark insisted. He thinks the glass helps get engineers talking to each other, which leads to a better plane. And Clark is obsessed with building a better plane.\n\nThe prototypes parked in the hangar are the first two iterations of Beta\'s latest, most promising design. With a 50-foot wingspan and a tall V-shaped tail, the aircraft dubbed Alia uses four propellers to lift like a drone and a fifth to fly forward like a plane. It\'s designed to carry six people or three pallets of cargo up to 250 miles, powered entirely by rechargeable electric batteries.\n\nAlia represents an aviation breakthrough-in-waiting, physical evidence of how the far-off vision of flight without fossil fuel has become tantalizingly close.\n\nFor many, the nascent electric aviation field is synonymous with a fascination for flying cars. A new class of experimental aircraft called electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL), which includes Alia, promises quiet, efficient propulsion and the nimbleness of a helicopter. Add in advances toward pilotless operation, and the aircraft could usher in radically different skyscapes and personal transportation networks, the thinking goes. Accordingly, Silicon Valley has jumped in to fuel a race to create the first big electric air taxi company.\n\nBeta, homegrown in the less-vaunted Champlain Valley, has leapt toward the front of the pack by charting a different flight path. Since founding the startup in 2017, Clark has been focused not on the Jetsons but on the planet. The quickest way to begin moving air travel away from fossil fuels, Clark said at a recent conference, is to build "insanely reliable" aircraft that are capable of more straightforward uses, such as transporting cargo.\n\nMuch of the work to achieve that goal takes place in labs on the South Burlington hangar\'s first floor, where there\'s considerably less glass than the trendy office space above. Here, Beta\'s engineers continue to refine the cutting-edge electric motors and control systems they\'ve been developing quietly for the last few years.\n\nOliver Parini\n\nThe hangar at Beta Technologies\n\nBetween an electronics lab and the 3D printing shop is a pair of rooms that Clark — a slightly scruffy, six-foot-six engineer, serial entrepreneur and former pro hockey draft pick — introduces with a mechanic\'s charm as the "torture chambers."\n\nIn these tiny thunderdomes, Beta\'s most precious components get stuffed into cages and pushed toward their breaking point. They\'re cooked and frozen and shocked with the same voltage as a lightning strike. They\'re also strapped to a vibration table and rattled according to computer-programmed frequencies, "maybe a Metallica song, or maybe an airplane vibration modal spectrum," Clark said. In separate containers on airport grounds, Beta\'s electric motors spin on 13 testing devices called dynamometers to gauge their durability.\n\n"We just beat the shit out of motors continuously," Clark said.\n\nThe company\'s first-things-first approach is beginning to pay off. Since its unveiling last June, Alia has undertaken some of the most advanced flight testing in the industry and now regularly flies 100-mile practice routes over Chittenden County. Last week, the U.S. Air Force granted Alia approval to fly on behalf of the military, only the second electric aircraft authorized to do so.\n\nIn April, Beta signed a deal to sell at least 10 of its roughly $4 million aircraft to United Parcel Service by 2024; UPS says it will use them on some of its regional express delivery routes, flying packages between warehouses instead of airports. Beta\'s also committed to delivering up to 20 planes to Blade, a company that currently offers $800 helicopter rides from Manhattan to the Hamptons. Beta\'s workforce has grown from 75 employees a year ago to more than 230 and counting, as the company plans a big push toward flight certification and production.\n\nOn the cusp of pioneering commercial electric aviation, Beta could quickly become one of Vermont\'s largest companies if it can successfully compete in a new global market. Clark and his wife, Katie, met in middle school in Essex and dream of their community becoming a "green aviation stronghold." But the startup is far from alone in its quest, and its flurry of achievements comes as competitors have raked in gobs of investor cash — more than $4 billion in 2021 so far.\n\nBeta raised $143 million in new private capital in March and was in the process of raising $190 million more, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure filed April 1 but unreported until now. Some industry analysts believe the cost to bring a new plane to market is even greater, but they nonetheless consider Beta a top contender because of its tangible progress in a speculative industry.\n\n"It\'s a program that\'s more likely to make it than others," said Brian Foley, a longtime aerospace consultant, offering a levelheaded assessment. "But it\'s still, like many of them, somewhat precarious."\n\n\'You\'re On\'\n\nOliver Parini\n\nKyle Clark\n\nClark, 41, has been imagining different ways of flying for a long time. As a senior at Harvard University in 2004, he exuded confidence when his thesis project was named best in his engineering class. The young airplane and motorcycle enthusiast built a flight simulator based on a motorcycle chassis that could more intuitively match the roll and pitch pilots experience while flying. "I have every intention of taking this project through to completion," he told the university\'s newswire, the Harvard Gazette.\n\nBy "completion," Clark meant producing a functional aircraft that the pilot can roll a sport bike into, use it to pilot the plane, and upon landing ride it out — in other words, a flying motorcycle. "The feasibility study is complete, and the concept is indeed realistic," he was quoted as saying.\n\nThe project didn\'t materialize, nor did his other ambition, professional hockey. The Washington Capitals drafted the Harvard winger in 1999. He played a couple of seasons on its minor league affiliates but proved a better enforcer than goal scorer.\n\nThe Clarks moved back to Vermont, where Kyle cofounded iTherm Technologies, a maker of induction heating power supplies, in Colchester. He sold the company to Dynapower in South Burlington and became that company\'s director of engineering, working on power electronics and battery systems. He and another Dynapower alum later started Designbook, now Venture.co, as a social networking and investment-seeking platform for tech entrepreneurs. Kyle\'s collegiate "cycleplane" concept resurfaced as the example he liked to use of a business venture that could benefit from Designbook.\n\nIn March 2017, Clark was giving a presentation on batteries for an aviation company in Philadelphia when someone in the audience stopped him. "Who are you, and why are you here?" Clark recalled being asked.\n\nHis interrogator was Martine Rothblatt, the author, entrepreneur and futurist who is one of the more interesting rich people in the world. Rothblatt, who has a home in Vermont, founded Sirius Satellite Radio and, after her daughter was diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension, started the now-publicly traded biotechnology company United Therapeutics to cure her disease. As a trans woman, Rothblatt has advocated for the rights of trans and gender-nonconforming people. She and her wife, Bina Aspen, launched the Terasem Movement, a group of educational and religious organizations that seek to transplant human consciousness through technology and that operate out of Lincoln. One of Terasem\'s projects involved replicating Bina as an artificial intelligence robot named Bina48.\n\nRothblatt took note of Clark\'s enthusiasm and their shared Vermont ties and invited him for coffee the next time she was around. She wanted to know how he would go about developing an electric aircraft, Clark said.\n\nElectric aviation was having a moment. In October 2016, the ride-hailing giant Uber issued a white paper that laid out a vision for a network of on-demand, pilotless electric air taxis within a decade. The small aircraft would be able to take off from and land on helipads atop buildings, shortening urban commutes.\n\nRothblatt, a helicopter pilot, was exploring electric flight, as well, but for her own reasons. She wanted a fleet of carbon-neutral aircraft that could transport the human organs that United Therapeutics hopes to manufacture before 2030. She\'d worked with a team of California engineers in 2016 to test fly a conventional helicopter retrofitted with a rechargeable battery. That same year, United Therapeutics subsidiary Lung Biotechnology invested $10 million in a Chinese startup, EHang, that is developing eVTOL planes. But Rothblatt was still looking to place another bet. She was in Philadelphia that day, she told Seven Days, to hear from another company that was looking into the technology; Clark was there as one of its potential contractors.\n\n"It\'s kind of my nature as a technologist to always have multiple shots on goal," she said.\n\nClark struck Rothblatt as having the "perfect mixture" of the skills she was looking for: "somebody who completely understands how to build and execute businesses for electric power," she recalled, "and somebody who is also a pilot and completely understands flying."\n\nTheir coffee date turned into a daylong visit and a request that Clark put some ideas in writing, he recalled. He returned to his Underhill home and drew up a business proposal, accenting it with watercolors to make it pop. The document, which he sent her at 4 a.m. the next day, asked United Therapeutics to put up $1.5 million in initial funding while Clark would contribute an equivalent value toward a rather conceptual goal: "elicit critical thinking in electric aviation."\n\nLater that morning, he recalled, Rothblatt texted him: "You\'re on."\n\nRothblatt\'s backing helped Beta bring other investors and advisers aboard, including Dean Kamen, the New Hampshire-based creator of the Segway; Stone Point Capital CEO and Vermont native Charles Davis; and Boston Scientific cofounder and Shelburne resident John Abele. Clark was able to recruit top Vermont talent, including Steve Arms, founder of Williston sensor maker MicroStrain, who joined Beta in its first year. Clark also tapped locals, such as Ben Colbourn, who said he was working in Burlington\'s Generator maker space when Clark called looking for anyone knowledgeable about drones. Colbourn now oversees Beta\'s 3D printers, making sophisticated shapes from specialty materials at a rapid pace.\n\nOliver Parini\n\nBenjamin Colbourn making scaled models of the Alia aircraft with a 3D printer\n\nEarly on, Clark approached Burlington International Airport in search of space for his startup. Airport director of aviation Gene Richards agreed to lease an aging hangar used by maintenance staff in exchange for repairs and improvements. To run flight tests, Beta also leased space across Lake Champlain at Plattsburgh International Airport, site of a former U.S. Air Force base.\n\nWithin 10 months, Beta\'s small team had designed, built and hovered its first eVTOL prototype in virtual secrecy. Ava, a somewhat spindly craft that wielded eight tilting propellers, served as a demonstration project. Its successful hover testing reeled in a $48 million contract from Rothblatt\'s company.\n\nOnce Ava was aloft, Clark said, he sent his first investor and potential customer sketches of what would become Alia. More importantly, Clark said, he pitched Rothblatt on his approach to making an aircraft that would have real-world use.\n\n"It is focusing really deep into the motors, batteries, inverters, and being relatively conventional on the stuff that doesn\'t deserve innovation quite yet," he said late last month. "The materials science, the interiors, the avionics, the flight controls — those things are not going to take us from guzzling fuel in a jet engine to a new form of aviation. But the electric propulsion is."\n\nLift and Cruise\n\nOliver Parini\n\nAndrew Giroux working on air-cooled inverters\n\nCommercial air travel accounts for roughly 3 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The relatively small figure is expected to grow, and unlike the auto industry, aviation hasn\'t had a clear path to renewable alternatives.\n\nElectric flight is limited by both the amount of energy today\'s batteries can store relative to their weight — far less than jet fuel — and the immense power that aircraft need their propulsion systems to deliver to stay in the air.\n\nAdvancements in battery technology and the efficiency of electric motors in recent years have made electric-powered flight more plausible for small aircraft capable of carrying light loads for relatively short distances.\n\n"The amount of power density you can get at any one time is better than it has been before, and the amount of power you need is less than it has been before," said Nicholas Roy, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "So if the question is, \'Well, why now?,\' it\'s the convergence of those two things. Do I think it has converged enough to really make this viable? That I don\'t know."\n\nBeta has designed its electric propulsion system from the ground up. Alia uses powerful and efficient permanent magnet motors, the same family of motors used in today\'s electric cars. Clark said the company\'s 400-horsepower motors, which are air-cooled and don\'t require a gearbox, are capable of converting about 95 percent of electric energy into thrust.\n\n"This is our core technology internally," Clark said as he showed off the motor\'s components.\n\nCircuit boards for the inverters that control the motors are also designed in-house, while employees assemble massive battery packs from lithium-ion cells in a series of shipping containers next to the hangar.\n\nBeta\'s decision to develop its own propulsion components distinguishes it from many of its competitors, who have partnered with legacy aviation firms such as Rolls-Royce and Safran, said Foley, the aviation analyst.\n\nAlia\'s design takes advantage of Beta\'s in-house propulsion expertise. Whereas Ava, like many of the air taxis in development, used tiltable propellers to lift vertically and move forward, Alia has separate systems for lift and cruise that use motors specifically designed for each function. The design reflects Clark\'s emphasis on pragmatic thinking. "Real innovation happens as you say, \'How do I get that performance without increasing complexity?\'" he said.\n\nAlia is one of the largest, heaviest and most aerodynamic eVTOL designs to be built, said Mike Hirschberg, executive director of the Vertical Flight Society, a nonprofit industry educational group. Simplicity isn\'t typically a marker of strong performance in aviation, Hirschberg said, "but I think Beta has a nice balance." He considers the company one of the leading eVTOL developers, out of more than 200 who have put forward designs.\n\nLast year, Beta got permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to begin initial test flights for Alia within a designated patch of airspace around the Plattsburgh airport.\n\nClark, who also serves as one of Beta\'s four test pilots, flew the prototype off airport property for the first time on New Year\'s Day this year. By March, the company had done enough successful testing that the FAA allowed Alia to fly beyond the initial flight area. Another pilot flew the aircraft across Lake Champlain back to BTV, where testing continues almost daily.\n\nMost of the flight testing so far has been in fixed-wing mode, with the lift propellers detached and wheels installed under the fuselage. Alia had completed its 101st fixed-wing flight on the day that Clark took Seven Days for a tour of the hangar. Publicly available flight data from FlightAware tracked the aircraft flying more than 90 miles back and forth over Essex at a peak altitude of 5,900 feet and a top speed of 150 miles per hour.\n\nBeta is one of the first companies working with the U.S. Air Force through an unusual public-private program intended to accelerate eVTOL development. Launched in 2020, Agility Prime makes Department of Defense funding and resources available to eVTOL developers and helps the Air Force evaluate whether the new forms of aircraft may have military applications. Knowing a homegrown company was working in the field, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) helped funnel an extra $25 million into Agility Prime last year, his office said. The Air Force conducted ground tests on Alia last year to help establish its airworthiness, while Beta installed immersive flight simulators in Springfield, Ohio, and Washington, D.C., so officials can explore scenarios in which the aircraft might be useful.\n\nWith the military airworthiness authorization granted to Alia last month, the company can now conduct flight tests on the Air Force\'s dime as part of a contract that will pay Beta up to $44 million, Clark said. In a press release, Air Force Col. Nathan Diller said Beta\'s progress "shows the high level of maturity" of the company and emerging eVTOL technology.\n\nGoing to Market\n\nCourtesy Of Brian Jenkins/Beta Technologies\n\nThe Alia flying over Burlington\n\nNot everyone is sold. Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Virginia-based aerospace and defense analyst Teal Group, isn\'t necessarily skeptical about the progress in electric-aviation technology. He just thinks the notion that today\'s electric aircraft developers are revolutionizing travel is absurd.\n\nAboulafia is amused by what he considers an increasingly collective amnesia about the lessons of aviation\'s past. At the turn of the millennium, Eclipse Aviation, a dot-com-era darling, attracted hundreds of millions in investment to develop superlight, inexpensive personal jets that promised to democratize flight. The jets, it turned out, were not so cheap to make, and the company collapsed with $1 billion in debt.\n\nTo Aboulafia, today\'s ventures seem awfully familiar. Electric air taxi proponents, he argues, are overstating the market for a product that\'s still incredibly expensive to build. Helicopters are a niche industry, and it\'s hard to see electric equivalents — even though they are quieter and cheaper to maintain — expanding the market as dramatically as tech futurists and the people who give them money imagine.\n\n"This is a recipe for carnage," he said. "Absolute carnage."\n\nThe last few months have seen a massive acceleration in funding for flying car startups, according to Robin Riedel, a more bullish analyst for McKinsey & Company. The consulting firm has tracked more than $4 billion in eVTOL investment so far in 2021, far more than last year or the $1 billion that was publicly disclosed in 2019.\n\nMost of the recent capital has been provided through Wall Street\'s latest craze: special-purpose acquisition companies. SPACs, sometimes called blank-check companies, are publicly traded shells that exist solely to find a private company with which to merge. In the last couple of years they\'ve become attractive as shortcuts to a traditional public offering. Three eVTOL makers have used the tool since February to raise as much as $1.6 billion each.\n\nMcKinsey projects that the global market for passenger eVTOL flights could be at least $300 billion annually. Others have estimated even larger revenue potential. "The investments that are going into this are reasonable," Riedel said, "if that is actually the market."\n\nAll that cash is crucial for startups to get a new kind of aircraft certified by the FAA and into production for commercial flight, which likely would cost more than $750 million, several analysts told Seven Days. Some eVTOL makers have said they can get it done within the next two to three years.\n\nClark asserts that Beta doesn\'t need as much money as the other companies because it has a clearer, quicker path to regulatory approval and a more straightforward business model. Unlike some other companies, Beta isn\'t trying to also establish a new passenger airline — it\'s just selling aircraft.\n\nAsked during an interview in late April whether he was considering taking the company public to raise more money, Clark said that doing so would bring a "whole boatload of disadvantages," namely the requirement to communicate with public investors.\n\n"We have the fortunate advantage of only having to convince our customers and the FAA that we have a safe, reliable aircraft that serves our mission," he said. "Not only do you get deposits and down payments from the customers, but you get credibility with alternative sources of funds."\n\nThough Alia can be outfitted for pilotless urban travel, Beta is working primarily with UPS and United Therapeutics for regional piloted flights. Clark expects that the barriers to using the aircraft for cargo will be significantly lower. Its contract with UPS has an option to expand to 150 aircraft; Rothblatt said her company is seeking to deploy 60 aircraft in 2026.\n\neVTOL developers focusing on cargo uses have yet to attract investors to the same degree as those working on passenger applications, Riedel noted. Part of the reason is that planes are currently a small part of logistics and shipping businesses; the time they save usually isn\'t worth the cost.\n\n"The cargo case really requires much more of a shift that is unknown," he said.\n\nUnited Therapeutics is looking for planes that can fulfill organ delivery missions, but Rothblatt said the company\'s primary interest in eVTOL designs stems from its commitment to sustainability.\n\n"It\'s no sense for us to be saving people\'s lives with organ transplants if we\'re trashing the whole world environment," she said.\n\nOf her several bets on eVTOL, Rothblatt said Beta is poised to offer the longest flight range with a feasible route to certification.\n\n"Kyle has designed a path for Beta which is challenging to get the FAA certification but definitely doable," she said. "And when he gets it, his aircraft will have the best performance characteristics, in my opinion, of any of the others."\n\nBuilding Out\n\nOliver Parini\n\nKyle Clark (left) operating the flight simulator as reporter Derek Brouwer watches\n\nRothblatt\'s backing, Clark said, has allowed him to design the company according to his own vision, with a culture to reflect it.\n\nSome aspects of Beta\'s organizational ethos can seem like tech startup gimmicks. Beta\'s many job postings seek engineers and technicians but also "gurus" and "ninjas." Yet once they join the company, employees refer to their job titles almost universally as "teammate." Clark insists there\'s merit to the idea. For example, taking time off doesn\'t hinge on supervisor approval but on teammates\' agreement that the absence of a fellow worker won\'t leave them in the lurch.\n\nThe result is a cadre of entrepreneurial employees who, Clark said, "just care a whole hell of a lot about what they\'re doing, as opposed to a bunch of people that are trying to follow instructions or conform to something or climb the corporate ladder."\n\nSince the beginning, Beta has encouraged all of its "teammates" to attain a pilot\'s license on company time under the tutelage of its several certified instructors. More than 30 have licenses, and 100 more are in training. The program has helped instill broader affection for and understanding of aviation, which leads, Clark believes, to smarter design.\n\nKatie Clark oversees marketing, though she recently refashioned the marketing meetings as "band practice" to avoid boxing in their thinking. She hired a local chef to make lunch each day for the growing staff, who on a recent Wednesday stood in the rain for lunch at the company food truck. Katie and Kyle\'s four children, whom they homeschool, spend a lot of time at the office, too. Their 18-year-old daughter, Willa, has been working at Beta since she was 16. She said she started flying planes before she learned to drive.\n\nAs flight testing continues, the company is also gearing up to attain FAA certification and to manufacture Alia. Last fall Beta hired Matt Cherouny, a 35-year-old manufacturing engineer, to assess how to bring Alia into production. Cherouny grew up in South Burlington, attended the University of Vermont and worked for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters before going to work for Tesla in California several years ago. He\'s one of many Beta engineers who earned their degrees in Vermont.\n\n"Visiting Beta made me realize I can move back to Vermont and I don\'t have to sacrifice my career and my personal beliefs" about sustainability, Cherouny said. He piloted his first solo flight last month, which was celebrated according to aviation tradition: by cutting off a piece of the shirt he was wearing.\n\nBeta has not yet decided where to set up manufacturing operations, though it may well be at BTV. Vermont Business Magazine recently quoted a local contractor who said the company was eyeing a manufacturing facility there. Airport director Richards said Beta has an option to expand onto an open, nearly 40-acre parcel at the south end of the property. He confirmed "informal negotiations" with Beta about using it.\n\nClark\'s goal, he said, is to continue growing the business in Vermont, the home state of both his family and more than half of Beta\'s employees. He sees advantages to locating manufacturing operations near the engineering, so long as it also makes business sense. "Obviously, that requires everything from local community support to political support to financial reasons to make all that happen," he said.\n\nPublic officials are eager to help. Beta was approved over the winter for a Vermont Employment Growth Incentive payment of up to $2.8 million, according to state records. Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said in an interview that Beta is on track to have a "very significant economic impact" in the region doing work that dovetails with the city\'s climate priorities. "We will work hard to make the opportunity right when Beta is ready to make that decision," he said.\n\nAfter Leahy visited Beta last week, a spokesperson said he will urge Congress to consider boosting the country\'s electric aircraft industry through President Joe Biden\'s proposed infrastructure bill.\n\n"Beta has a very bright future," Leahy said in a statement, "and I want that future to be based right here in Vermont."\n\nIn the meantime, Beta is laying the literal groundwork to support its vision of electric flight. Like electric cars, an electric air network requires places to charge.\n\nThe company has devised an all-in-one landing and recharging system that can be installed at airports, warehouses and other locations. The units can charge any kind of electric vehicle and use battery banks to limit how much energy is pulled from the grid at any given time. Alia can be recharged in less than an hour, Beta says.\n\nThe company has already built out a network of recharging stations from Burlington to Springfield, Ohio, through small airports in western New York State that will enable Alia to make a longer trek. Clark plans to expand the network up and down the East and West coasts and eventually establish landing and recharging infrastructure nationwide.\n\nA Beta-funded project to electrify Rutland\'s airport was under way last month, state aviation manager Dan Delabruere said. Some regional governments are already considering pursuing federal funds to add infrastructure to support electric aircraft.\n\nThe recharging stations, constructed in Williston, feature a landing deck perched above four containers that provide resting quarters, battery supply and a repair shop.

So we can’t show you photos of the aircraft, but we can tell you that it’s a significant evolution of the company’s previous prototype, Ava-XC, with ALIA having four fixed propellers mounted above the fuselage and one dedicated pushing propeller, rather than eight pivoting prop and motor assemblies.\n\nBeta Technologies founder and chief test pilot Kyle Clark at the controls of his previous eVTOL prototype, Ava-XC.

That’s the kind of range it will need to transport human organs for launch customer United Therapeutics, whose CEO, Martine Rothblatt, is the primary customer for the project.\n\nNot that Ava-XC is anything to sniff at. Although it resembles the Edward Scissorhands version of a Lancair airplane, that prototype has successfully completed more than 200 test flights, most of those with Clark at the controls. “It was an amazing learning experience — it showed us what the most important things in an eVTOL [are],” Clark told the audience at TexasUP.\n\nTo design Ava’s successor, the Beta team started with the mission requirements — carrying two people and an appropriately packaged human organ — then applied “the very first principles of engineering,” Clark said. “Make it light, store a lot of energy, convert that energy efficiently, and make a slippery airplane. Then do it in the simplest way possible.”\n\nBeta’s Ava-XC in the hangar. ALIA looks significantly different, with four fixed rotors and one dedicated pushing propeller. Eric Adams Photo\n\nAlthough their effort started with sketches and computer modeling, it quickly moved into scaled models. “Analytics are great, but it’s hard to hold this team back [from] building real things,” Clark said. “The team here is going through flight testing of scale models over and over and over again, and battle-hardening themselves for the real test. . . . .\n\n“They’re [exploring] the limits of transition corridors, and failures of motors, and lost links, and IMU [inertial measurement unit] failures, and all these things that we don’t want to do in the real plane.”\n\nTo validate the edgewise flight loads on ALIA’s VTOL propellers, Beta modified a Ford F550 truck for high-speed ground testing — an approach that is as “simple and easy” as it is effective, Clark said. “We get it to 120 knots, build a 14-foot rig on top of it, put one of these propellers up there, and rip down the runway.”\n\nThe team has also built a complete “iron bird” test rig to validate integration of the aircraft’s systems, and experiment with different approaches for pilot control. Clark said that Beta is additionally using the iron bird to test failure modes in a way that will gain credit toward certification from the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\n“This is something that’s important to our program — that we build and deploy and engineer three to four times the amount of test equipment than we do airplane equipment,” he said.\n\nKyle Clark in the simulator. Beta has used simulation extensively in development of its aircraft, and will also incorporate simulators into its flight training academy for eVTOL pilots. Eric Adams Photo\n\nEven with the intense focus on readying ALIA for its upcoming first flight, Beta is not neglecting the ecosystem in which it will operate. As Clark put it, “none of this works without a recharging pad,” so Beta and United Therapeutics have been developing prototypes for a network of recharging pads up and down the East Coast, strategically positioned for organ transport missions.\n\nThe recharging pads will perform “energy arbitrage” using battery installations to avoid putting peaky loads on the grid. According to Clark, this should reduce the need for utilities to rely on fossil fuels to meet demand, and can further support the broader penetration of renewables by providing stabilizing real and reactive power back to the grid.\n\nBeta and United Therapeutics are even designing homey rest quarters for the pilots who will be flying the organ transport missions, since “the pilots are really important in this thing,” Clark said. He noted that Beta is simultaneously developing a flight training curriculum that will prepare pilots for this new type of aircraft, which is not quite a helicopter, and not quite an airplane.\n\n“A theme which I think we all need to be aware of as an industry [is] a lack of pilots. . . .

The mechanism for the debut was a leisurely — if not downright balletic — helicopter airlift across Lake Champlain to its official testing ground, a former Air Force base in Plattsburgh, New York.\n\nThe roughly 30-minute operation saw the sleek, four-rotor airplane — one of the anticipated front-runners in the global race to launch a viable, fully electric VTOL aircraft — suspended 100 feet below a massive Sikorsky S-61N operated by Quebec-based lift specialist Helicarrier. The pair crossed over the northern end of Burlington, with streets along its route blocked off by police, then flew at a stately pace across the lake, usually just a few hundred feet above the surface of the water.\n\nHelicarrier makes quick work of even the most challenging lifts, from refrigeration units in dicey urban environments to industrial machinery. If it’s under 10,000 pounds (4,535 kilograms) and can be attached to a long line, the company will move it for you. But Alia is a different kettle of fish. For starters, it’s a priceless prototype. Being forced to activate the emergency release and dump it in the lake if something went wrong — something Helicarrier has never had to do — would set the program back at least a year.\n\n“For the most part, what we do typically encompasses things like water buckets on fires or salvage recovery of other crashed airplanes,” said pilot Aaron Lighter, who flew the mission with spotter Fred Carrier, the co-owner and president of the company. “It’s not very often we fly brand-new, experimental, multimillion-dollar projects like this. So, yeah, this is outside our scope a little bit. But at the end of the day it’s a piece of equipment on the end of a long line, and we are very capable of getting it there safely.”\n\nHelicarrier’s load experts and Beta’s engineers collaborated closely in the weeks and months leading up to the airlift to ensure the aerodynamically fine-tuned Alia wouldn’t get a mind of her own in transit. That was unlikely, of course, given that Alia’s stall speed is 90 knots, and the airlift would be well below that at 40 knots, but still, the 6,000-lb. (2,720-kg) maximum take-off weight airplane was stripped down to just over 3,000 lb. (1,360 kg), so it had the potential to float a bit if a good gust of wind caught its wide 50-foot (15-meter) wings just so. Add in other aerodynamic qualities designed into the innovative bird, and a simple slow crawl across a lake on a sunny day could become anything but.\n\nTo prepare, engineers removed the four hover motors on the airplane’s two outriggers and replaced them with anchor hooks to which the ropes would be attached. Some batteries remained on board to ensure that the fly-by-wire control surfaces could be positioned to help spoil the airplane’s lift. Personnel also removed the pusher motor, which powers horizontal flight, and put tape over the window seams to ensure the Velcro-affixed canopy — something that makes it easily accessible during testing — would stay in place. Finally, the teams ensured the aircraft had a slight, three-degree nose-down attitude when suspended, and they installed a drag chute in the rear of the aircraft to help it remain stable in the wind, allowing it to weathervane as necessary without spinning out of control.', {'entities': [(163, 180, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (295, 299, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (457, 466, 'GOVERNMENT_AGENCY'), (766, 777, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (995, 1006, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (1258, 1262, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (1443, 1454, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (2052, 2063, 'PARTNER_COMPANY'), (2083, 2087, 'UAM_COMPANY'), (2212, 2216, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (2301, 2305, 'UAM_PRODUCT'), (2314, 2331, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2402, 2410, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2413, 2421, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2487, 2495, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2498, 2506, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2587, 2594, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE'), (2596, 2604, 'PRODUCT_FIGURE')]}), ("In the few short years that the modern electric air taxi movement has been gestating—launching in earnest with Uber’s October 2016 proposal for such a service—attention has swirled around the key technological and policy hurdles, from battery propulsion to new aircraft designs to regulation. Little of the conversation, however, has focused on what may be the greatest enabler, or hurdle, of this new way of moving: the public.\n\nYou know, the folks who’ll actually be riding in these newfangled contraptions. Do they understand how they work? Will they be comfortable flying through the air in small, and eventually unmanned, vehicles? It’s not enough to promise that these aircraft will be quieter than helicopters or show off CGI animations of a typical flight. If these things are going to fill the skies, the people who today are on the ground must be onboard, metaphorically as much as literally.\n\nWant the latest flying car news landing in your inbox? Sign up here!\n\nThat was the essence of the message delivered by former Wyoming governor Matt Mead to an industry gathering at a ranch outside of Dallas last month. “I tell people I’m going to an eVTOL gathering and they think I mean a health conference,” he said at TexasUP, an invitation-only, unannounced summit that followed a similar event held in Arkansas last year. “You folks all live in this world and you understand it so very well. But for a lay person like myself, it's hard to get the passion. It's hard to get the excitement when you first have to explain what the letters mean. Then they say, ‘Oh, are you talking about flying cars?’”\n\nMead’s point was not just that the industry needs to stamp out or standardize jargon but that doing so will help push citizens, including politicians, to support it. The public is generally good with the idea of electric air taxis, according to a study released early this year by Airbus, though they have concerns around safety and noise. But studies have yet to gauge attitudes toward the broader impact of the technology. “We have to talk about the benefits and the realization of the dream—the amount of hours saved commuting, what it would mean to the GDP, what it would mean for public safety, search and rescue, and more,” Mead said. “Plus, this is an opportunity to democratize our airspace, and to do it safely.”\n\nPhotograph: Eric Adams\n\nTo reach the best likelihood for success, this argument goes, air taxis should benefit as many, and annoy as few, people as possible. Missteps here can bring down the wrath of publicly elected officials. Consider the fact that New York City is weighing legislation to ban non-emergency helicopter use, in an effort to address noise and safety concerns.", {'entities': [(1225, 1232, 'EVENT'), (1890, 1896, 'UAM_COMPANY')]}), ('Photo by Eric Adams ©, used with permission.\n\nIt seems not a week goes by without the introduction of another electric vertical take-off & landing (eVTOL) startup. Today is no exception, with Beta Technologies, an eVTOL startup from Vermont, joining the crowd.\n\nKyle Clark wasted no time gathering top-notch engineers from GE Global Research, Scaled Composites, and Tesla, among a few others, as well as the right tools and equipment to build what he sees as the ultimate eVTOL urban air mobility (UAM) vehicles, according to The Drive. The Ava XC is very different from many eVTOL designs we’re accustomed to seeing. It’s part airplane, part tilt-rotor, but nothing like an Osprey.\n\nThe Beta Technologies air taxi prototype looks more traditional than the futuristic eVTOL designs of late. His is a heavily modified airplane airframe with 90-degree tilting wings and ailerons supporting 8 electric motors on each end. The aircraft is perched on high landing gears, presumably to accommodate the tilting rotors.\n\nTechnically, the Ava XC weighs in a 4,400 lb (1,815 kilo), with a 35-foot (10.7-meter) wing, and has so far accumulated well over 180 test flights approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). And where was it hiding all these years? Under a two-year development shrouded under a secret cloak.\n\nAccording to Vertical Mag, the Ava XC uses 124 kWh lithium-ion battery packs. Its top speed is 154 knots (177 mph). It will fly 150 miles (240 kilometers) on a full charge, but the production model should reach up to 290 miles (465 kilometers).\n\nAs to how safe it is, Clark says the Ava XC was tested at 72 knots and a maximum altitude of 100 feet, with winds as high as 25 knots.\n\nThe startup under wrap until this past week received undisclosed funding from United Therapeutics, which is led by SiriusXM satellite radio founder Martine Rothblatt. The Eva XC is not expected to come into production until 2024. And according to Rothblatt:\n\n“We’ve seen seven percent improvements in energy density every year for the past several decades. We need 300 watt-hours per kilogram in order to reach a range of 250 nautical miles, which is what I’m asking for, and it’s a no-brainer to see that we’ll be there in just a few years.”\n\nClark says using electric motors means having constant torque at any speed and to a certain extent any altitude. The choice of a distributed propulsion system means the flight controls react with instantaneous thrust adjustments at any power level. You won’t hear otherwise here on CleanTechnica. Clark also believes that with an ultra-precise control at any speed and attitude, an eVTOL can safely cut power off, avoid collisions, and even freefall and recover from a stall.\n\nAs to how it is piloted, the Ava XC uses a hybrid flight control design with a collective lever in the left hand that modulates the speed of the propellers and thrust. Clark says the control is much lighter than a conventional helicopter collective. The traditional foot pedals control the rudder and clockwise/counter-clockwise differential of the rotors.\n\nThere is a right-hand sidestick for the mechanical flight control surfaces and the fly-by-wire controller for distributed propulsion. The right thumb controls a bump switch that tilts the nacelles that modulate the tilt angle and sink rate.\n\nAs to how it feels to fly the Ava XC, Clark says: “I liken it to a glassy water landing in a sea plane where you come in … and all you’re doing is looking at the VSI [vertical speed indicator] and you’re setting your sink rate. The same thing’s true when you’re moving this thing forward — if you can feel anything, you know you’re doing something wrong. So you start to bump that in a particular direction to either increase the vertical component of lift or the horizontal component of thrust.”\n\nBeta Technologies, More than an eVTOL Startup\n\nClark definitely has big dreams for Beta Technologies. He is converting to electricity a vintage Enstrom 28FX helicopter to test the direct-drive electric motors for his Ava XC air taxi prototype. The startup is also working on a solar- and grid-powered recharging pad technology. Clark hopes to install its wireless charging stations in strategic places.\n\nClark says that Beta Technologies has an approved simulator-based training program designed to train powered lift test pilots. He believes it is the only one in the industry. The simulator is most likely due to having Austin Meyer, the creator of the popular flight simulation software X-Plane, on the team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave a tip for CleanTechnica, want to advertise, or want to suggest a guest for our CleanTech Talk podcast?
